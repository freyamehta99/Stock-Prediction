Date,Analysis: Spectre of capital flight slows China FX reform drive, SHANGHAI  Reuters  Longtime China watchers probably felt a sense of deja vu when HSBCs chief China economist Qu Hongbin predicted last month that the yuan would be convertible within five years   China has been thwarting such predictions since 1993 when it first formally adopted capital account convertibility as a longterm goal Consummate China insider Fred Hu who stepped down as Goldman Sachs Greater China chairman in 2010 to launch a private equity fund made a similar prediction in 2002 just before Chinas last political leadership transition Market watchers remain bullish on capital account loosening  pointing to positive signals from the central bank  but the importance the political leadership places on the countrys foreign exchange reserves as a guarantor of economic stability remains a major obstacle Indeed signs that outflows are accelerating have already provoked concern from policymakers We shouldnt interpret capital account convertibility as a free currency with crossborder asset transfers without control Peoples Bank of Chinas PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan told a forum in Hainan province on Monday We will reserve the right to monitor and restrict capital flows in some sensitive areas Zhou said SECURITY BLANKET Analysts say the central bank is the center of proreform sentiment in the government But other policymakers still equate foreign reserves with national strength and may oppose any reform that would put the 33 trillion stockpile at risk To them the FX reserves underpin confidence in the financial system serving as a security blanket for both the government and financial markets Few believe Chinas banks are as healthy as they claim while many local governments and stateowned enterprises are awash in debt But as long as investors and depositors believe Beijing could tap its foreign exchange reserves to fund a bailout a run on banks or a credit crunch for local governments and stateowned enterprises is unlikely Chinese households hold a huge amount of deposits said Yu Yongding a former member of the central banks monetary policy committee China has 84 trillion yuan 1345 trillion in corporate and household bank deposits If households want to diversify their holdings into foreign assets say just 10 percent of their assets capital outflow will become huge which will lead to a fall of the yuan and then there will be panic and more outflows  a herd effect said Yu who is now director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences CASS MONEY LEAVING There are signs that some money is already leaving China Chinas trade and foreign direct investment FDI surpluses totaled 181 billion in the six months ending October official data shows But Chinese banks including the central banks purchased only about 32 billion in this period while firms kept another 53 billion onshore without converting it to local currency With capital controls in place the surpluses should have been roughly equal to the FX purchases and unconverted FX receipts Instead this analysis commonly used by analysts as a rough estimate of hot money flows indicates approximately 95 billion that was meant to be in China moved overseas in the sixmonth period The outflows are striking given the yuan appreciated sharply from late July and the US Federal Reserve launched a new round of quantitative easing in September Both factors would normally draw hot money into China Middleincome Chinese individuals are opening offshore bank accounts  among 40 to 50 year olds there is a real undercurrent of fear Jonathan Clifton managing director of Offshore Incorporations Group a consultancy that helps clients facilitate offshore investment told a conference in London last month organized by the newsletter OffshoreAlert SHRINKING SURPLUSES Even as Chinas economy boomed last decade there were a gross 38 trillion of illicit outflows from 2000 to 2011 according to a study released in October by Global Financial Integrity a Washington DCbased research and advocacy group Yet such outflows went largely unnoticed because they were overwhelmed by the massive trade and foreign direct investment surpluses Those twin surpluses were the main factors that swelled Chinas FX reserves by an average 25 billion per month in the decade from 2002 to 2011 But now those surpluses are shrinking in what some analysts expect to be a longterm trend In the context of narrowing surpluses on the current account and capital and financial accounts we must shift from guarding against the risk of capital inflow to guarding against capital outflow two officials from the PBOC wrote this week in China Finance a magazine backed by the central bank Over the first nine months of 2012 reserves rose an average of 115 billion  much of which would due to be interest on reserves already held rather than new inflows By the middle of next year China will tighten the capital account considerably said Andy Xie the former Morgan Stanley chief AsiaPacific economist and wellknown China analyst He added that lower trade surpluses in 2013 would spark concern among political leaders about capital outflows ROACH MOTEL Still optimism of an opening up persists There are clear signs that Chinas new leaders who will take power in early 2013 will make speeding up reform top of their policy agenda in the coming years HSBCs Qu wrote There have been a steady drumbeat of statements this year from the central bank including a widely noted report in February titled Conditions are basically mature for China to speed up capital account opening Even former central bank governor Dai Xianglong who spent much of the 1990s refusing to offer a timeline for capital account convertibility said this year that significant progress could now be made within five years In March regulators increased the foreign debt quota for foreign banks allowing them to bring in more capital In April authorities expanded the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor QFII granting foreigners greater access to Chinas capital markets But far from a shift towards allowing households more freedom to invest overseas these policies appear to be a continuation of Chinas longstanding approach to foreign capital flows which some compare to the popular roach motel

12/30/2014,Bill authorizing 2013 U.S. defense spending edges toward completion, WASHINGTON  Reuters  US lawmakers merged the competing House and Senate versions of the annual defense policy bill on Tuesday approving a measure that authorizes 6333 billion in defense spending for 2013 expands US sanctions on Iran and strikes restrictions on biofuel use   The legislation passed by a conference committee of lawmakers from both chambers is expected to go to the full Senate and House of Representatives for a final vote this week before being sent to President Barack Obama for his signature The measure authorizes a Pentagon base budget of 5275 billion plus 885 billion for overseas operations primarily the war in Afghanistan the House Armed Services Committee said in a statement The base spending includes some 174 billion for defenserelated Department of Energy nuclear programs The bill  the National Defense Authorization Act  sets defense policies and has been passed annually for 50 consecutive years Although it authorizes spending levels it does not actually commit funds That is done by the appropriations committees in both chambers in a separate piece of legislation The proposed base budget was 17 billion above Obamas request for defense spending in the 2013 fiscal year that began in October the House Armed Services Committee statement said The measure is making its way through Congress at a time when the Pentagon is having to trim 487 billion in spending over a decade and is facing another 500 billion in projected spending cuts over the same period beginning January 2 unless lawmakers agree to an alternative before then Obama and Congress are struggling to cut more than a trillion dollars in government spending by January 2 in an effort to slow the growth of the massive US debt If they fail to reach a deal the government will be hit by 12 trillion in automatic acrosstheboard cuts Defense Secretary Leon Panetta urged lawmakers on Tuesday to agree on a deal to avert the cuts and expressed concern about their efforts to use the authorization bill to divert funding to pet projects that the Pentagon has cut back He said the Pentagon had been working with the House and Senate on the authorization bill in the conference committee because legislation initially passed by the two chambers would have needlessly diverted 74 billion over the next decade into programs equipment and activities we dont want or need We must make every dollar count Panetta said in a speech to the National Press Club We must continue to carefully manage the balance between sustaining current operations being ready to respond to crisis and emerging threats preparing for future operations and investing in capabilities for the future The merged version of the bill passed by the conference committee on Tuesday includes a 17 percent pay increase for troops It also rejected an administration proposal to increase fees on the health insurance program for military retirees Analysts have pointed to personnel costs as one of the drivers of rising military expenditures and they have noted that military healthcare costs are increasing at an unsustainable rate just as they are in the civilian sector Army General Martin Dempsey who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the top US military officer told troops in Stuttgart Germany on Tuesday the Pentagon was exploring ways to rein in the growth of personnel costs Our manpower costs in  the whole Department of Defense budget are about 45 percent he told a town hall gathering If we breach 50 percent we will throw the system out of bounds It will mean that manpower costs are drawing a disproportionate and infeasible amount of the budget and that something will have to give  end strength and modernization most notably The authorization bill approved by the conference committee also assigns an additional 1000 Marines to embassy and consulate security in the wake of the attack on the consulate in Benghazi Libya that killed US Ambassador Christopher Stevens The bill also includes expanded sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program said Senator Carl Levin chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee The sanctions that we adopted are very very strong sanctions he told reporters We designate the people and the port and energy and shipping areas in Iran as entities of proliferation concern Levin said the panel rejected administration requests to broaden the exceptions to the sanctions but he said the legislation would give the administration more time to implement the measures The bill would also  Eliminate a House effort to prevent the military from buying biofuels that are more expensive than traditional petroleum The military has been paying high prices for biofuels for testing purposes but has said it would not buy large quantities until prices are competitive with traditional fuel  Require the Defense Department to do environmental impact tests on potential sites for an East Coast missile defense system The legislation would not mandate deployment of an East Coast missile defense or require an operational deployment plan  Increase cyber security by requiring companies doing business with the Defense Department to report to the Pentagon whenever cyber intruders breach their sensitive information systems  Ease export restrictions on satellite technology in an effort to improve US competitiveness in the sale of the equipment overseas Representative Adam Smith the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee said limits on the export threatened to undermine the ability of US firms to provide cutting edge technologies needed by the US military Reporting by David Alexander Editing by  Lisa Shumaker

multibilliondollar loss in a move that will end the automakers Government Motors era   Treasurys plan  a twostep process that includes a 55 billion stock sale to GM  is part of a broader push to wind down the controversial financial bailout under the Troubled Asset Relief TARP program TARP was created by former president George W Bush to prevent the collapse of the US banking industry during the 20072009 financial crisis The planned GM sale will raise the proceeds that Treasury has recovered to 286 billion of the 50 billion bailout GM received With 209 billion left from the original bailout the government would have to sell its remaining shares at an average price of 6972 to break even GM shares were up 71 percent at 2731 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange If Treasury which will reduce its stake to about 19 percent when the buyback closes this month from about 26 percent at present sold its remaining stock at the price GM is paying now it would come up short by more than 12 billion GM wins Jefferies analyst Peter Nesvold said pointing to the elimination of the government stake that has been acting as a drag on the stock price and to eventual higher earnings per share From a government standpoint its a mixed bag but they went into it to save jobs not as an investment He said the buyback was lower than the 30 a share he had expected at the very least and was occurring earlier than anticipated GMs planned buyback of 200 million shares will give it more freedom from government oversight and likely result in a sales boost as some consumers unhappy over the US taxpayerfunded bailout give the automaker a second look GM Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann said This is very attractive to the company to our shareholders he told reporters at GMs Detroit headquarters It obviously brings some clarity and certainty around the US Treasury exit Its obviously good for the business in terms of continuing to remove the perception of government involvement in the company which is going to be good for sales he said also noting that the reduced share count would boost earnings GM approached Treasury officials after the US presidential election in November but was rebuffed when it offered only to pay market value for the governments stock according to a senior Treasury official Treasury rejected a second offer of a small premium before the sides finalized the deal on Tuesday afternoon said the Treasury official who asked not to be identified discussing the negotiations Weve always looked at this as balancing speed of exit with maximizing return and GM basically made us what we felt was a very attractive offer the Treasury official said TARP TRIP NEARS END TARP was approved by Congress as a 700 billion program though Treasury eventually disbursed 418 billion On Wednesday it said it had recovered 381 billion to date or about 90 percent TARP was always meant to be a temporary emergency program The government should not be in the business of owning stakes in private companies for an indefinite period of time Treasury Assistant Secretary Timothy Massad said in a statement Moving to exit our investment in GM within the next 12 to 15 months is consistent with our dual goals of winding down TARP as soon as practicable and protecting taxpayer interests Under the deal GM will pay 2750 a share for the Treasuryheld shares representing a 79 percent premium on Tuesdays closing price Treasury said it will then sell its remaining stake of about 3001 million shares through various means in an orderly fashion and could begin the process including sales on the open market as soon as January The auto giant was dubbed Government Motors by many critics after it received its bailout package as part of the bankruptcy restructuring in 2009 under TARP Treasurys plans echo other recent moves On Tuesday Treasury said it would largely sell its remaining shares in bailedout banks over the coming 12 to 15 months Last week it sold the last of its common stock in American International Group Inc  AIGN  at a profit This also would close Treasurys involvement with the US auto sector In June 2011 the agency sold its remaining 6 percent stake in Chrysler to Italys Fiat SpA  FIAMI  which controls the US automaker US President Barack Obama heavily promoted his decision to use public funds to rescue the auto industry and save jobs as he campaigned for reelection in swing states like Michigan and Ohio Voters in both states backed him again in the November 6 election providing critical support in his victory Treasury officials reiterated on Wednesday that the auto bailout saved more than 1 million US jobs and was not meant to turn a profit With Treasurys planned exit from GM auto lender Ally Financial Inc will be the last major TARP recipient that has not yet paid back the government Of the 17 billion it owes Ally has paid back 58 billion SHOWING CONFIDENCE Separately on Wednesday Canada Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said his country had no immediate plans to sell its stake in GM Canada and the province of Ontario have a combined 9 percent stake Ammann said the move and resulting Treasury plans will remove a significant overhang on the stock that has hurt sales and bring an element of closure to the bailout Company research suggests eliminating the Treasury stake would benefit sales he said Ammann said the deal was good for shareholders when asked whether GM might be sued for paying Treasury a higher price than where the stock was trading at the time of the announcement However one large shareholder loved the deal as a spokesman for hedge fund manager David Einhorn said We applaud GM management for unlocking shareholder value by releasing excess capital and beginning a resolution of the government stake overhang Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said that once the government reduces its stake GM likely will be eligible for inclusion in the Standard  Poors 500 index  SPX  which could serve as a catalyst to drive up the companys stock price GM will end the year with estimated liquidity of about 38 billion even after the deal Ammann said That will add to earnings per share by reducing the number of outstanding shares by about 11 percent Ammann said the deal will be funded through cash and not tap in to the 11 billion credit line GM secured last month Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the deal showed GMs confidence in its ability to generate cash despite worries about the US economy and the recession in Europe The ability to spend this amount of money on a share buyback shows they are putting their money where their mouth is he said The deal also made a winner of Ammann considered one of a handful of GM executives who could succeed Chief Executive Dan Akerson Ammann along with Akerson and GM general counsel Michael Millikin negotiated the deal with Massad Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner chief investment officer Matt Pendo and government attorneys over several weeks according to the senior Treasury official and another person familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified Ammann did not provide details of the talks with Treasury when asked whether negotiations picked up following the presidential election Analysts said Treasury likely did not want this deal to be turned into a political issue Treasury also may have wanted to wait for the unveiling of the critical fullsize pickup trucks that will go on sale next year analysts said GM showed the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra on December 13 GM will take a charge of about 400 million in the fourth quarter tied to the buyback In addition Treasury relinquished certain governance rights including required levels of US manufacturing and barring the purchase of corporate jets Ammann said Senior executive payment caps under TARP remain in place For GM management it was very important to get out from under the Government Motors moniker Morgan Stanley

12/10/2014,Analysis: Traders hedge bets as budget talks turn to bluster, NEW YORKCHICAGO  Reuters  US markets in the last few weeks have conveyed a strong sense of optimism over Washingtons budget battle  perhaps a bit too much   The benchmark SP 500 index  SPX  recently capped off its best twoday run in a month and the euro reached an 812month peak against the dollar largely on expectations that an agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff  600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set for early next year  is nearly at hand But at the risk of sounding like Ebenezer Scrooge some investors fear a sudden run of bad news could snuff out the preholiday cheer and send stocks down As a result they are wading into the options market to hedge their bets and protect their profits With all the uncertainty we want exposure to sectors but we dont want to risk as much said Michael Matousek senior trader at US Global Investors Inc which manages about 3 billion We want to limit our positions because we dont know what will be impacted and by how much Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner in a brief press conference on Wednesday dared President Barack Obama to oppose Republican plans to cut taxes for all but those making 1 million or more in annual income After his remarks both the SP 500  SPX  and the Dow Jones industrials  DJI  hit the days lows Boehners gambit which followed another press conference where Obama suggested Republicans need to get over reflexive opposition of him shows the two sides still have work to do to bridge their divide It is very difficult to say if the optimism out there is warranted said Alec Young global equity strategist at SP Equity Research in New York We dont know whats going on behind the scenes and that makes it very difficult to account for all the uncertainty out there PLAYING IT SAFE Some investors have started to limit exposure to stocks that have had a strong runup A popular strategy is stock replacement which involves selling shares outright and instead buying a call option  a bet the stock will keep rising  on those securities This allows investors to take profits and also reduce risk particularly if budget talks break down and the market sells off But they retain the option to get in on the gains if things go well by exercising their call or buy options We have seen this strategy in eBay  EBAYO  Dell DELLO Juniper Networks  JNPRN  CocaCola  KON  and Starbucks  SBUXO  among others said Phillip Saunders an equity derivatives strategist at Topeka Capital Markets Another approach covered calls in which investors hang onto a position while simultaneously selling a call option on it to increase their income In this case if the asset falls in value some of the losses are offset by the premiums collected on the unexercised call option Its a strategy that Michael Fredericks who manages the BlackRock MultiAsset Income Fund has employed with high dividendyielding US stocks which could suffer if no deal is reached and dividend taxes spike from 15 percent to as high as 40 percent for some earners When you add the value of selling an options contract to the dividend payment some companies distribute you end up with a really attractive value proposition Fredericks said The benchmark SP 500 is up nearly 15 percent this year with three sectors  industrials financials and consumer discretionary shares hitting 2012 highs That has increased the desire to hedge On Wednesday put options  bets on a market decline  on the SP were trading more than three times the average volume of the past five trading days What this suggests is that people are buying options in the SP 500 index in order to protect themselves in case of a selloff into yearend said JJ Kinahan chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade TAIL RISK NARROWS Overall volatility remains low as stock trading winds down for the year The CBOE Volatility Index VIX Wall Streets fear gauge rose to 174 on Wednesday spiking after Boehners comments but still well below its longterm mean of 205 The market slipped following Boehners words with the SP ending down 076 percent but the overall low volatility suggested investors believe the outlook remains positive I definitely think there is some risk though said Douglas DePietro head of trading at Evercore Partners in New York adding that some investors were protecting themselves by buying funds that bet on declines in the SP 500 Currency investors who fear a plunge over the fiscal cliff should consider selling currencies with strong US links such as the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso against the Japanese yen which usually rises when risk aversion spikes said Steven Englander who heads Citigroups global G10 FX strategy He said some investors might be reluctant to hedge their bets now after having been overcautious in the past and missing out on the rally Unlike in early 2012 investors are no longer singularly focused on protecting against massive risks such as the 2008 market meltdown or the possible demise of the euro Through much of this year theseoutcomes were central scenarios that investors pursued and that in some cases weakened the returns that they got Englander said But Michael Khouw head of equity derivatives at CRT Capital Group in Stamford Connecticut said thin preholiday trade may be suppressing volatility somewhat I dont think that the options markets are overly complacent he said I would have expected option volume to drop off this year and it has not and this is a reflection of the fact that market participants could expect a sharp move up or down in equities Editing by  David Gaffen   Tiffany Wu  and  Leslie Gevirtz

11/25/2014,UBS traders charged bank fined $1.5 billion in Libor scandal, ZURICHNEW YORK  Reuters  US prosecutors charged two former UBS traders on Wednesday with taking part in a multiyear scheme to manipulate Libor and other benchmark interest rates making them the first individuals to be criminally accused in the international scandal   Earlier on Wednesday the Swiss bank admitted to fraud and bribery in connection with efforts to rig the interest rates and agreed to pay 15 billion in fines to regulators in the United States UK and Switzerland The charges against the two traders Tom Hayes and Roger Darin resulted from a broad investigation into the activities of more than a dozen banks in the setting of prices for Libor and related rates In settling with US UK and Swiss authorities UBS not only paid one of the largest fines ever imposed on a bank its Japanese subsidiary pleaded guilty to one US criminal count of fraud relating to manipulation of benchmark rates including the yen Libor The Japanese subsidiary is where authorities allege much of the manipulation of interest rates occurred as employees of the bank looked to profit on derivatives trades linked to the rates UBS is the second large international bank to reach a settlement with US and UK authorities and other settlements are expected to follow in the next few months In June Barclays Plc agreed to pay 453 million in fines to settle allegations its employees attempted to manipulate Libor rates The investigation and it findings  that attempts to manipulate Libor were fairly widespread in the banking industry  have cast doubts on the reliability of Libor as a benchmark for setting interest rates The probe has also raised questions about why bank regulators were slow to uncover the manipulation which Reuters previously reported dated back to at least the late 1990s The banks conduct was simply astonishing Lanny Breuer who heads the US Justice Departments criminal division said in announcing the settlement Make no mistake  for UBS traders the manipulation of Libor was about getting rich The Justice Department charged Hayes and Darin with conspiracy according to a criminal complaint unsealed in US district court in Manhattan on Wednesday Hayes was also charged with wire fraud and an antitrust violation US and UK investigators portrayed Hayes as a ringleader of sorts for UBS manipulation of rates The two men are both believed to be in Europe according to a US official Last week British police arrested Hayes and two other men in connection with the Libor probe The two others were Terry Farr and James Gilmour both of whom worked at interdealer broker RP Martin The 15 billion UBS penalty is the second largest ever imposed on a bank exceeded only by the 19 billion that HSBC agreed to pay to settle US charges in connection with the laundering of drug cartel money We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behavior No amount of profit is more important than the reputation of this firm said UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti The criminal complaint against Hayes and Darin also detailed how some former UBS employees are cooperating in the probe in exchange for a promise that they wont be prosecuted The cooperation agreements forged in the UBS case could prove useful to US and UK authorities as they move against other individuals and other big banks US prosecutors for instance are continuing to investigate the activities of a number of former Barclays derivatives traders based in New York who were dismissed from the bank following an internal investigation into Libor manipulation So far none of those former Barclays employees in the United States have been charged with wrongdoing Libor and related benchmarks are used to set interest rates for trillions of dollars worth of loans around the world ranging from home loans to credit cards to complex derivatives Authorities said traders could benefit on their derivatives positions by nudging the prices for Libor up just small amounts as over time the payoffs added up Already a number of civil lawsuits have been filed in the US by institutional investors claiming they were harmed on trades because of the interest rate rigging NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE In legal filings Britains Financial Services Authority FSA said UBS staff made corrupt payments to reward brokers for helping to manipulate rates  expanding the scandal to include bribery It said attempts to manipulate Libor and Euribor its European equivalent were so widespread that every submission UBS made over a sixyear period from 2005 to 2010 was suspect At least 45 people at UBS were involved in the rigging which was discussed in internal chat forums and group emails but never detected by compliance staff despite five audits The FSA said a wide pool of people within UBS considered the manipulation to be a normal business practice In addition to traders trying to move the Libor rate up or down to make money for themselves senior managers at the Swiss bank directed dealers to keep Libor submissions low during the financial crisis to make the bank look stronger Documents filed by the FSA did not reveal the names of individual participants but a source familiar with the matter identified Hayes as the FSAs Trader A who the regulator said embarked on a coordinated campaign to influence the yen Libor rate In 2006 Hayes told a junior submitter at UBS that he generally coordinate with Darin and skew the libors a bit In early 2007 Darin trained another junior submitter and told him the primary consideration for UBSs yen Libor submissions was the requests from Hayes and other UBS traders The extent of the wrongdoing was highlighted in a series of emails released by the FSA The exchanges may indicate how traders and brokers conspired to rig the rate while adopting nicknames such as Captain Caos sic and calling each other superman hero or the three muscateers sic In one email Trader A Hayes wrote to a broker urging him to keep the sixmonth yen Libor rate unchanged on the day Traders paid brokers as much as 15000 pounds 24000 a quarter for their help in rigging the rates It is the first time that brokers have been accused of taking bribes to aid the manipulation ICAP the worlds largest interdealer broker and rival RP Martin have suspended employees in connection with the probe Until the raterigging scandal broke Libor had been ignored by regulators and left to the banks to police From next year Britains FSA will oversee it as part of a major overhaul The steep fine for UBS comes even as the bank has cooperated with lawenforcement agencies The bank said it received conditional immunity from some regulators The investigation into UBSs trading shows that the manipulation of the benchmark rates and illicit trading took place over a much longer time period than previously thought with the improper requests extending into June 2010 according to the UBS settlement with the Justice Department UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR UBS will pay 12 billion to the Justice Department and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission 160 million pounds to the FSA and 59 million Swiss francs from its estimated profit to Swiss regulator Finma The UK penalty is the largest in the history of the FSA and more than double the 59 million pounds paid by Barclays UBS said the fines would widen its fourthquarter net loss but that it would not need to raise new capital UBS shares fell 03 percent in trading on Wednesday after earlier hitting a 17month high The reputational impact of the controversy may only emerge next year The only thing shareholders can do is keep a very close eye on the money flows on the wealth management side said Neil Wilkinson portfolio manager at Royal London Asset Management 1  09133

11/24/2014,Instagram tests new limits in user privacy, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Instagram which spurred suspicions this week that it would sell user photos after revising its terms of service has sparked renewed debate about how much control over personal data users must give up to live and participate in a world steeped in social media   In forcefully establishing a new set of usage terms Instagram the massively popular photosharing service owned by Facebook Inc has claimed some rights that have been practically unheard of among its prominent social media peers legal experts and consumer advocates say Users who decline to accept Instagrams new privacy policy have one month to delete their accounts or they will be bound by the new terms Another clause appears to waive the rights of minors on the service And in the wake of a classaction settlement involving Facebook and privacy issues Instagram has added terms to shield itself from similar litigation All told the revised terms reflect a new draconian grip over user rights experts say This is all uncharted territory said Jay Edelson a partner at the Chicago law firm Edelson McGuire If Instagram is to encourage as many lawsuits as possible and as much backlash as possible then they succeeded Instagrams new policies which go into effect January 16 lay the groundwork for the company to begin generating advertising revenue by giving marketers the right to display profile pictures and other personal information such as who users follow in advertisements The new terms which allow an advertiser to pay Instagram to display your username likeness photos along with any associated metadata without compensation triggered an outburst of complaints on the Web on Tuesday from users upset that Instagram would make money from their uploaded content The uproar prompted a lengthy blog post from the company to clarify the changes with CEO Kevin Systrom saying the company had no current plans to incorporate photos taken by users into ads Instagram declined comment beyond its blog post which failed to appease critics including National Geographic which suspended new posts to Instagram We are very concerned with the direction of the proposed new terms of service and if they remain as presented we may close our account said National Geographic an early Instagram adopter PUSHING BOUNDARIES Consumer advocates said Facebook was using Instagrams aggressive new terms to push the boundaries of how social media sites can make money while its own hands were tied by recent agreements with regulators and class action plaintiffs Under the terms of a 2011 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission Facebook is required to get user consent before personal information is shared beyond their privacy settings A preliminary class action lawsuit settlement with Facebook allows users to optout of being included in the sponsored stories ads that use their personal information Under Instagrams new terms users who want to optout must simply quit using the service Instagram has given people a pretty stark choice Take it or leave and if you leave it youve got to leave the service said Kurt Opsahl a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation a Internet user rights group Whats more he said if a user initially agrees to the new terms but then has a change of mind their information could still be used for commercial purposes In a post on its official blog on Tuesday Instagram did not address another controversial provision that states that if a child under the age of 18 uses the service then it is implied that his or her parent has tacitly agreed to Instagrams terms The notion is that minors cant be bound to a contract And that also means they cant be bound to a provision that says they agree to waive the rights said the EFFs Opsahl BLOCKING CLASS ACTION SUITS While Facebook continues to be bogged in its own class action suit Instagram took preventive steps to avoid a similar legal morass Its new terms of service require users with a legal complaint to enter arbitration rather than take the company to court It prohibits users from joining a class action lawsuit unless they mail a written optout statement to Facebooks headquarters in Menlo Park within 30 days of joining Instagram That provision is not included in terms of service for other leading social media companies like Twitter Google YouTube or even Facebook itself and it immunizes Instagram from many forms of legal liability said Michael Rustad a professor at Suffolk University Law School Rustad who has studied the terms of services for 157 social media services said just 10 contained provisions prohibiting class action lawsuits The clause effectively cripples users who want to legally challenge the company because lawyers will not likely represent an individual plaintiff Rustad argued No lawyers will take these cases Rustad said In consumer arbitration cases everything is stacked against the consumer Its a pretense its a legal fiction that there are remedies Instagram which has 100 million users allows consumers to tweak the photos they take on their smartphones and share the images with friends Facebook acquired Instagram in September for 715 million Instagrams takeitorleaveit policy pushes the envelope for how social networking companies treat user privacy issues said Marc Rotenberg the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center I think Facebook is probably using Instagram to see how far it can press this advertising model said Rotenberg If they can keep a lot of users then all those users have agreed to have their images as part of advertising Additional reporting by Dan Levine Editing by  Jeremy

11/14/2014,SAC Capital's top consumer trader draws U.S. scrutiny, NEW YORK  Reuters  US authorities are examining trading by one of SAC Capital Advisors most successful portfolio managers Gabriel Plotkin as part of a probe into the 14 billion hedge fund firms investment in Weight Watchers International Inc last year according to a person familiar with the investigation   Plotkin a specialist in consumer and retail stocks who makes investment decisions for more than 12 billion worth of assets is among several SAC portfolio managers whose trades are being investigated said the source who did not want to be identified The source would not name the other managers Federal authorities are trying to determine whether any of SAC Capitals retail and consumer portfolio managers traded Weight Watchers shares and options based on nonpublic confidential information about the diet company said the source and another person familiar with the investigation The two sources said it was too soon to conclude if there was any insider trading Authorities have not charged Plotkin with any wrongdoing Plotkin who is based in New York and works for SAC Capitals Sigma Capital Management division did not return a request for comment Gabe Plotkin has built a successful career on a commitment to sound fundamental research said an SAC Capital spokesman who declined to comment on the Weight Watchers probe With a hedge fund the size of SAC Capital which was founded 20 years ago by Steven A Cohen it is not uncommon for many portfolio managers to be trading the same stocks Last year Plotkin and his team of a halfdozen traders and analysts produced between 150 million and 200 million in profits for Cohens fund some of which came from trades of shares of Weight Watchers said a person familiar with the hedge fund who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak for SAC Capital Over the past two years Plotkin 34 has emerged as one of the most successful portfolio managers at SAC Capital said this person Plotkin and his wife own a condo on Manhattans Upper East Side as well as a home in Southampton which is part of the Hamptons summer playground for the citys wealthy The Weight Watchers inquiry first reported by Reuters on December 7 is focusing on trading by SAC Capital in the first half of 2011 when the Stamford Connecticutbased hedge fund bought and sold some 21 million shares during a period when the diet companys stock price roughly doubled The probe is the latest in a long line of investigations by federal authorities dating back to at least 2007 that have looked into whether some of SAC Capitals outsized performance is the result of trades relying on insider information A spokesman for US prosecutors in New York declined to comment Plotkin is one of 11 portfolio managers at SAC Capital who trade consumer and retail stocks It is not clear how many of those managers all of whom manage less money than Plotkin are being scrutinized by federal authorities Plotkin who came to SAC Capital in 2006 from North Sound Capital is widely known in the 2 trillion hedge fund industry as one of the top consumer and retail traders said several people who know him Last year the Northwestern University graduate was one of several guest speakers at a Wharton Investment Management Conference Also in 2011 Plotkin was named a consumer stock top gun investor by Brendan Wood International a company that specializes in ranking top investors for corporations Plotkins name recently surfaced in several emails that federal prosecutors introduced into evidence in a separate insider trading case In that case Todd Newman a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management and Anthony Chiasson cofounder of Level Global Investors on Monday were convicted of illegal trading in Dell Inc shares The emails involved discussions by Jon Horvath  a former trader at SAC Capitals Sigma division who pleaded guilty in September to trading on inside information  with his former supervisor Michael Steinberg and Plotkin The prosecutors used the emails to persuade a federal judge to declare Steinberg an uncharged coconspirator for the purposes of the trial In the emails reviewed by Reuters there was a discussion between Steinberg and Horvath about Dells upcoming earnings These emails were also sent to Plotkin In an August 2008 email to Steinberg and Plotkin Horvath writes he has a 2nd hand read from someone at the company about gross margins and earnings Steinberg whose lawyer did not return a request for comment has not been charged with any wrongdoing US prosecutors the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been gradually ratcheting up pressure on Cohen 56 one of the hedge fund industrys bestknown managers Two weeks ago US prosecutors charged a former SAC Capital employee Mathew Martoma with using inside information to generate profits and avoid losses totaling 276 million in shares of two drug stocks Martoma has not entered a plea but his lawyer has said he expects to be exonerated The SEC also has formally warned SAC Capital that the firm could face civil charges Martoma is the seventh person once associated with SAC Capital to be either charged or implicated by federal authorities in insider trading Authorities have not charged Cohen with any wrongdoing and the firm has repeatedly said it has strong compliance measures in place The investigations have not had a visible impact on SAC Capitals investor redemptions or employee turnover The investigation into trading in Weight Watchers comes as federal authorities are also looking at trading by SAC Capital in shares of biotech company InterMune Inc in 2010 A person familiar with the InterMune and Weight Watchers investigation said authorities are looking into some of the trading done by former SAC Capital portfolio manager Nikej Shah Shah who left SAC Capital last year did not return several

11/06/2014,Analysis: Too big to fail? China's wealth management products stir debate, HONG KONG  Reuters  The default of a Chinese investment plan has handed Beijing a tough choice bail out investors and endorse moral hazard or let it fail and risk unnerving those who hold at least 1 trillion in socalled wealth management products   Chinas bank regulators are debating what to do about the investment sold at a Hua Xia Bank  600015SS  branch near Shanghai which failed to pay out on maturity late last month The bank a midsized lender partly owned by Deutsche Bank  DBKGnDE  says a Jiading district branch employee sold the product without authorization Angry investors protested outside the branch for a week That marked the first time  since warnings earlier this year from regulators and even one top bank executive who said some Chinese wealth management products were akin to a Ponzi scheme  that a failed product grabbed national media attention Its not yet clear how many and to what extent others have defaulted But analysts say that if more flop and generate headlines like the Hua Xia case a crisis in confidence could ensue sparking a run on the wealth product market Some of these products wont be able to generate enough money to pay back investors said BofAMerrill Lynch  BACN  China strategist David Cui The issue is at a certain point if it gets to a certain scale you can no longer cover up the losses Then we may have a systematic risk on our hands Wealth management products have taken off in the past five years with Chinese looking for investment choices other than real estate betting on the countrys rollercoaster stock markets or parking money in bank accounts that offer stateset deposit rates The majority of the products are shortterm savings vehicles often created by third parties and issued through banks The products mostly invest in stocks and money market instruments promising returns of 45 percent But a sizeable amount have funneled money into riskier investments offering doubledigit gains by financing anything from property and infrastructure projects to car dealerships pop concerts and even the sale of ham The products are part of Chinas shadow banking system  or credit given to borrowers outside formal lending channels Barclays estimates the shadow banking industry has nearly doubled in the past two years to 256 trillion yuan 411 trillion or more than a third of total lending Beijing has not forced Hua Xia Bank to pay back the estimated 500 investors hit by the default China International Capital Corp CICC a prominent Chinese investment bank urged regulators in a December 4 note to allow such products to fail Most are not guaranteed by banks analysts say If we dont take this opportunity to let a relatively smallscale contract be broken it will only reinforce the attitude that these products have a rigid return and a limitless guarantee CICC said Forcing Hua Xia to stand behind these products would cause no end of trouble it added In a sign of how sensitive the issue has become the China Banking Regulatory Commission CBRC recently told reporters not to ask about Hua Xia Reports by some Chinese media have been taken off their websites The CBRC confirmed a report on Wednesday in the Southern Metropolis Daily which said the regulator had sent an urgent notice to banks ordering them to check thirdparty financial products sold through their branches mainly trusts insurance and investment funds IDL4N09T22Q At the same time state media have stepped up efforts to warn of the risks associated with certain wealth products The official China Securities Journal on Saturday warned investors about a product called Good Voice an 800 million yuan investment offering doubledigit returns from music concerts The same article mentioned one that invested in hams launched last month by Jinzi Ham Co Ltd 002515SZ offering returns above 10 percent CHINAS VERSION OF THE CDO Wealth management products shot to prominence after Chinas stock markets sank during the 2008 global financial crisis As China pumped up its economy and inflation surged past official interest rates investors sought higher returns elsewhere rather than effectively lose money in bank deposits Since then the number of products in circulation has jumped from a few hundred to around 29000 according to one estimate Chinas wealth products have been likened to the USinvented collateralized debt obligation CDO That product pooled together loans mostly American mortgages and sold them to hedge funds When home owners defaulted and hedge funds stopped buying CDOs banks were left with packaged loans they couldnt sell That helped cause the 2008 financial crisis Beijing has tolerated wealth products because they offered alternative investment opportunities and channeled credit to industries in need The CBRC put the total outstanding at 67 trillion yuan 108 trillion as of September nearly double the year before Fitch Ratings predicts total sales will hit 13 trillion yuan by the yearend or more than 16 percent of total bank deposits THE HUA XIA CASE The advertised yield on the product issued by Hua Xia Bank was 1113 percent over one year more than triple the one year state mandated 3 percent deposit rate Created on November 25 2011 by a firm called the Zhongding Wealth Investment Center the product planned to invest 200 million yuan in a pawn shop two car dealerships and a TV production company according to the prospectus The product required a minimum 500000 yuan individual investment although sources with knowledge of the investment vehicle said money was pooled among various groups According to CICC 160 million yuan was raised The protests began when the product failed to pay out its annualized return on the given date It was unclear if investors had permanently lost their principal payment and interest INVESTOR PSYCHOLOGY Sanford Bernstein analyst Mike Werner said less than 10 percent of products promised a yield of more than 5 percent meaning most are fairly low risk Working out how many need to default before they threaten Chinas financial system is impossible to tell because the real threat is investor psychology he said If Chinese investors stop buying wealth products en masse that would likely cause a liquidity crunch and force Beijing to react according to Werner The government will step in if social stability is at risk Werner said Cui from BofAMerrill Lynch said any loss of confidence in wealth management products would have wider consequences This can be selfreinforcing Once people stop buying them for fear of potential defaults in addition to the solvency risk the market will face liquidity risk as well he said Analysts suspect a lot of lenders are using new money to pay old customers that have invested in wealth products Banking analysts use the term assetliability mismatch to describe the practice which they have seen increase over the last year as Chinas economy has slowed and its stock market has slumped A Ponzi scheme is what Xiao Gang chairman of Bank of China  3988HK   601988SS  the countrys number 4 lender called certain wealth products in a newspaper editorial in October A Ponzi scheme collapses when new money no longer comes in and old investors cannot be paid CALL IN THE CHIPS Around 70 percent of wealth products are tied to bond and money markets Where the rest goes is less clear The government has said principal guaranteed products offered by banks must be counted on a lenders balance sheet That means banks are on the hook for the roughly 15 percent of products in circulation they have guaranteed Analysts agree that if a host of wealth products went bust it would cause a liquidity crunch At the very least banks would be expected to cover losses and pay investors principal plus interest on products that had been guaranteed They said that banks particularly large ones probably had enough cash on hand to cover any losses Fitch analyst Charlene Chu said smaller banks were now major sellers of the products and that shorter maturity dates were rising That means in some cases products with a 3month maturity were being used to fund real estate and infrastructure projects that would take far longer to finish The ability of a smaller bank to handle a run on wealth products was a concern she said With more products at these entities the sector is more susceptible to repayment issues Chu wrote in a recent report One analyst who covers Chinese banks said the most drastic government action would be if it called in all the chips and forced banks trust companies and other providers of wealth products to mark the plans to market which would reveal the actual value of the product compared to what was promised He was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter May Yan head of Asia bank research at Barclays said the market needed failure to educate domestic investors about taking excessive financial risks At the same time the government needed to be aware of the pressure that would fall on banks should customers demand repayment She predicted the banking regulator and the central bank would tighten up on wealth products and shadow banking in 2013 If the product fails it is a big step forward for risk awareness in China Yan said If banks need to bail everyone out the implications would be very negative 1  62415 Chinese yuan Additional reporting by

06/11/2014,Swisscom builds 'Swiss Cloud' as spying storm rages, ZURICH  Reuters  Swisscom is building a Swiss Cloud that could loosen the grip of US technology giants and attract foreign companies looking for a way to shield sensitive data from the prying eyes of foreign intelligence services   Companies are increasingly turning to cloud computing  an umbrella term for technology services such as email and business software offered remotely via the Internet instead of onsite  to cut costs and add flexibility to their IT departments But revelations that the US National Security Agency NSA secretly gathered user data from nine big US tech companies including Google Apple and Facebook has demonstrated that privacy for users of cloud services can be compromised and some suggest customers could seek out alternatives to the dominant US providers to try and protect sensitive information Swisscoms head of IT services Andreas Koenig told Reuters the telecom providers decision to set up a home cloud was unrelated to the recent NSA revelations and driven more by a desire to cut costs and make its systems more dynamic Still as the technology to protect against illegal threats progresses Koenig says it will start to make more sense to store data in locations where strict privacy laws make it harder to retrieve sensitive information Data protection and privacy is a long tradition in Switzerland and thats why its pretty difficult to get to something Koenig said But if legal requirements are there and we are asked by the judge to obtain or deliver certain information then we would obviously have to comply with it Unlike in the United States where the 2001 Patriot Act and the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISAA gives US intelligence agencies the power to carry out mass information gathering Swisscom would have to receive a formal request from a prosecutor before allowing access to data Yet while Swiss privacy laws will govern data stored locally in Switzerland Swisscom says it is hard to guarantee the security of data that crosses borders such as information exchanged by employees working in different countries Concern over the extent of foreign intelligence access to data has unnerved many countries including Germany where statebacked Deutsche Telekom wants communications firms to collaborate to shield local internet traffic INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY Swisscom which is majorityowned by the Swiss government wants to be at the forefront of new technology to monitor and detect illegal threats such as hacking If you are a provider in a cloud environment you need to apply the highest standards of security you can get said Koenig adding the company was implementing new ways to look at intrusion and data threats He said improvements in technology such as HTML 5 a new programming language for websites that can support apps on many different platforms would make it harder to retrieve data Its like opening a data tunnel from the server to your screen and then displaying the data on your screen That makes it pretty pretty difficult for anyone to see whats there In Switzerland which upholds privacy and data secrecy for its citizens and has long profited from providing discreet banking services to foreigners the NSA surveillance furor is particularly sensitive The Swiss government is worried about surveillance of Switzerlands more than 2 trillion financial centre and is seeking measures to ensure against spying Basler Zeitung reported last week citing sources Swisscom is subject to regulation requiring it to store all client data in Switzerland The company counts banks among its biggest clients and the countrys financial regulator FINMA also stipulates that data and data transfer must happen within Switzerland For now the company is focusing on its Swissbased clients but says it would have the capacity to support demand from foreign companies seeking a privacy haven Koenig declined to disclose how much Swisscom was investing in its cloud nor how much it was planning to charge potential clients for the service but said it would be competitive with other providers such as Amazon Web Services and International Business Machines He said Swisscoms goal was to have 70 percent of its own IT infrastructure in the cloud by 2016 the equivalent of 200300 petabytes of data According to analysts at Deloitte Analytics it would take 223000 DVDs to hold just one petabyte Additional reporting by Katharina Bart Editing by Will Waterman
06/10/2014,Banks hope futuristic flagships can tempt new customers, VELIZY France  Reuters  Installation art interactive walls and a robot doorman the flagship branches of the worlds top banks have come a long way from the iron grilles and potted plants of old   To compete against onlineonly rivals and to attract a new generation of customers to branches banks are installing sleek interiors and hitech gadgetry ATMs that read fingerprints touchscreen desks to flick through your finances and videoconference units for expert advice are all on display at paymentstechnology firm Wincor Nixdorfs  WINGDE  showroom in the Paris suburb of Velizy Banks are investing a lot in their retail branches said Steve Bousabata head of Wincors French banking services arm They want customers to come back The reason is clear after years of relying on branches to drive retail revenue European banks expect such networks to supply only 62 percent of sales by 2020 from todays average of 81 percent according to Equinox Consulting Banks especially those still nursing losses from the financial crisis are under pressure to cut costs and are balancing the need to pare back branch networks by sprucing up select outlets But branches are still the first point of contact for many customers and are still the primary location for product sales like mortgages new accounts and insurance underlining the importance of upgrading them for a more techsavvy generation The difficulty is knowing exactly what belongs in the branch of the future and what is better left behind Are all the things we see in branches today going to be seen in branches tomorrow I very much doubt that said Mike Baxter head of management consultancy Bains Americas Financial Services practice Theres an awful lot of experimentation of stuff that turns out to be unsuccessful and uneconomic Flashy bank of the future branches mixing gadgetry with design similar to Apples  AAPLO  minimalist stores have been opened by BNP Paribas  BNPPPA  in

business were up at its newly revamped flagship branch in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia which offers welcoming scents and a touchscreen wall Visits are up by an average of 60 percent while loans and

yet Increased ATM functionality as used by Citibank  CN  Asia and more secure biometric readers are also promising he added The ultimate question of whether to scrap the branch entirely is one that is not being considered consultants said The preference is for a hubandspoke model that pools resources in urban areas and reduces smaller rural branches While this may lead to more ambitious flagship

06/06/2014,Chip designers see dollar signs in Bitcoin miners, SUNNYVALE California  Reuters  Tucked away in an air conditioned data center in Silicon Valley is a hodgepodge of black boxes circuit boards and cooling fans owned by 27yearold Aaron JacksonWilde a modernday prospector looking for Bitcoins   Since discovering the digital currency a few months ago JacksonWilde has paid about 2000 for his rigs which are powered by specialized computer chips They are designed to help operate and maintain the Bitcoin network  and in return generate a small reward in a process known as Bitcoin mining A form of electronic money independent of traditional banking Bitcoins started circulating in 2009 and have since become the most prominent of several fledgling digital currencies While they quickly gained a reputation for facilitating drug deals and money laundering Bitcoins have of late garnered attention from investors such as venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz The volume of transactions using Bitcoins today remains miniscule but enthusiasts believe the peertopeer currency will play a major role in ecommerce and could eventually become as ubiquitous as email Bitcoin mining is based on a unique feature of the digital currency Unlike traditional currencies where a central bank decides how much money to print based on goals like controlling inflation no central authority governs the supply of Bitcoins Instead Bitcoin transactions are tracked by a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and prevent counterfeit The system automatically generates new Bitcoins as the math problems are solved and rewards them to the computer operators In a key twist that keeps inflation in check the difficulty of the cryptographic math that leads to newly minted coins grows as more computers join the network That has led some technology professionals to target a new market in soupedup computers and specialized chips aimed at the growing ranks of Bitcoin miners Consider Ravi Iyengar who first heard of Bitcoins about six months ago Since then he has quit his job as a senior chip architect at Samsung Electronics and raised 15 million to launch CoinTerra He says he has already presold more than 5 million worth of the hardware he has designed for Bitcoin mining Ive been in arms races throughout my career  AMD ARM Intel said Iyengar referring to prominent semiconductor companies but none of them match the intensity of Bitcoin mining Each month in Bitcoin mining is like a year PERISHABLE SILICON Little is known about exactly who started Bitcoin but the concept was introduced in a 2008 paper written under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto Since then Satoshi Nakamoto has become sort of a patron saint among advocates pushing for Bitcoins as an alternative to national currencies Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets is not run by any person or group and its value depends on peoples confidence in the currency The dollar price of Bitcoins has spiked over the past year as more people became aware of the currency and speculators jumped into the market which remains highly volatile Bitcoin recently broke 200 compared to 12 a year ago The goal of Bitcoin miners is to pull in more than what they spend on their rigs  some cost over 20000  and the electricity they need to keep the machines running 24 hours a day That is no easy feat In the past three months miners added so much gear with drastically improved chips that processing power on the network jumped from 289 terahashes per second to more than 4000 terahashes per second according to The Genesis Block a blog that collects Bitcoin data In reaction the network drove up the difficulty of verifying each cryptographic block of transaction data making it even harder to break even on investments in costly mining gear Bitcoin makes silicon perishable said Andreas Antonopoulos a digital currency entrepreneur in San Francisco Your mining rig rots away in front of your eyes every day you have it It has become so hard to make a profit that comparisons to the 19th century California gold rush when money was often made selling shovels to naive prospectors have become a running joke among Bitcoin miners Its the guys who sell the equipment who are making the money not the Bitcoin miners said JacksonWilde a manager at a company that makes motorcycle batteries CoinTerra believes spending on new Bitcoin mining chips could easily hit 100 million a year for the next three years assuming no change in prices While that is peanuts for large semiconductor companies like Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc it is a lucrative market for a handful of small developers About 119 million Bitcoins worth 24 billion at recent prices have been minted since the currency began circulating Based on recent activity the network is on track to create around 14 million new Bitcoins annually over the next three years the equivalent of more than 280 million a year at recent exchange rates Reflecting growing competition JacksonWilde says his gear  which features model names like Erupter Jalapeno and Spartan  now pulls in a tiny fraction of the Bitcoins it used to but he expects another 10000 worth of nextgeneration equipment to put him in the black Despite the expenditures he considers himself a hobbyist committed to supporting the Bitcoin network rather than a serious digitalcurrency investor Buying and selling Bitcoins is enticing but its not as enticing as being part of it and actually having hardware he said HOBBY STATE Mining with a simple laptop PC was easy back in 2009 when the fledgling Bitcoin network was a fraction of its current size But within a year hobbyists found that graphics chips often referred to as GPUs and widely used by PC gamers could provide a major boost in mining output Miners cobbled together dozens of graphics chips in their garages and basements surrounded by fans to keep the electronics from overheating Then in 2010 entrepreneurs caught wind Jeff Ownby and a handful of colleagues had just formed Butterfly Labs with the goal of using offtheshelf programmable chips known as FPGAs to help banks run complex financial risk simulations As we were starting down the road planning this we read about Bitcoin and said Wow this is exactly what were trying to do here Ownby said It was pretty much in a hobby state so we thought this might be something Butterfly Labs and other startups optimized FPGAs which are more typically used in factories and telecommunications gear to work efficiently on the Bitcoin network In 2012 the Bitcoin arms race escalated again when Butterfly Labs and rivals all with little or no semiconductor engineering experience started designing chips from the ground up Custom chips known as application specific integrated circuits ASICs are normally made by companies focused on highvolume products like televisions  not startups making small batches of digital mining devices Theyre the Wild West said John Cheng head of California basedCustom Silicon Solutions which helped Butterfly Labs design and manufacture its ASIC Theres a certain rhythm youre used to in the chip business Its usually two or three years before your ramp but these guys wanted to ramp in six months Butterfly Labs said on Thursday it recently took a downpayment for new mining gear in Bitcoins equivalent to 1 million the largestever transaction in the digital currency It identified the customer as HashTrade a company selling contracts for cloudbased Bitcoin mining run in data centers David Johnston executive director of BitAngels an investment group says consolidation in Bitcoin mining is well underway Mining has been going through these different generations and going up a learning curve from amateurs running CPUs and GPUs to new professionally funded companies with experienced chip designers taking it to the state of the art Johnston said Still there remain plenty of oddities in the Bitcoin mining business Johnston cited ASICMiner which both sells mining rigs and runs its own mining operations as one of the largest and most respected operators The company has even sold stock to online investors who paid in Bitcoins ASICMiner recently had a market value equivalent to 50 million according to data on the BitFunder online exchange But few know where the company is located or even who is in charge The chief executive communicates through web forums under the pseudonym Friedcat Reporting by Noel Randewich Editing by Jonathan Weber  Tiffany Wu  and  Tim Dobbyn

Lee who plans to buy one of the flats offered by New World Development and Wheelock  Company Ltd in the prime location near Kowloon West for his family Signs on the ground point to a clear pickup in demand from local and Chinese buyers thanks in part to steep discounts offered by developers to offset higher stamp duties imposed a year ago to cool prices that have jumped 120 percent since 2008 The boom was fuelled in large measure by the Federal Reserves dollar printing campaign or quantitative easing to drag the US economy out of the global financial crisis It became easy to borrow cheaply and with Hong Kongs currency pegged to the US dollar the effects of the policy were easily transmitted to the property market But now some analysts expect property prices to fall as the Fed is expected to start withdrawing its monetary stimulus some time during coming months Regardless many home buyers like Lee have shrugged off recent forecasts of a drop of up to 50 percent in prices over the next 12 months and decided to take a chance You see that people who earn less than you have caught up with you because they bought then Its like a girl you liked got married Lee said Last weekend long queues at one project prompted developer Hang Lung Properties to postpone presales and change the firstcome firstserve rule to a ballot system in which more than 400 buyers competed for just 80 units priced from HK8 million to HK15 million 193 million Industry watchers said up to 30 percent of buyers at recent popular projects were mainland Chinese whose presence in the new luxury home market had fallen to less than 12 percent from 43 percent after cooling steps in October last year SWEETENERS LURE BUYERS With stamp duty subsidies from developers many Chinese buyers are attracted back to the market CLSA property analyst Nicole Wong said referring to a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers that many believe was targeted at mainland Chinese Its like there is no government tightening at all  developers cancel it for the Chinese buyers In another sign of strong demand new home transactions rose to a sixmonth high in September according to real estate company Centaline Property Agency Some analysts say the recent frenzy has also been spurred by people rushing in before an expected interest rate hike which could lead to a collapse in Hong Kongs property market They buyers are concerned that the banks will further tighten up credit said Jennifer Wong tax partner at global accounting firm KPMG in Hong Kong This is one of the reasons they dont mind to pay a little bit more  they can secure the mortgage loan at a low interest Almost everything hangs on when the Fed decides to taper as a rise in US interest rates would drive up borrowing costs in Hong Kong where home prices have risen 4 percent over the past year on ultralow interest rates tight supply and abundant liquidity since cooling measures were imposed REALITY CHECK While the picture on the ground looks promising analysts see property prices undergoing a sharp correction Deutsche Bank forecast last month that Hong Kong home prices could drop up to 50 percent in the next 12 months while Barclays said the market will enter its first real downturn since 1998 with a 30 percent plunge by 2015 The developers created this wow factor They managed to draw out some people who wanted to buy and were looking for price cuts said Barclays property analyst Paul Louie citing two recent projects that offered discounts of up to 40 percent We are just seeing the beginning of the round of price cutting There will be more to come he said The buyers will return to the sidelines and wait for better deals The price difference between new launches and secondhand homes  an indicator of developers profitability  dropped to its lowest since 2003 at 12 percent in the third quarter of 2013 according to real estate company Midland Realty Hang Lung Properties and New World Development declined to comment on whether they would continue to offer discounts Wong Leung Sing research director at Centaline Property Agency believed the buyers rather than the analysts would be proven correct over the price trend We cant find the factors that will lead the market to plunge Wong said Investors are still quite optimistic More than 5000 smalltomedium units will be released by developers such as Cheung Kong and Sino Land in the first quarter of next year pushing inventory of new homes to a tenyear high and posting what Wong called a real test to mass consumers purchasing power The day of reckoning will be decided by the middle class Wong said CALLING THE BOTTOM Amid forecasts of a collapse in the property market and general gloom over the outlook for home prices there are still some who say the worst is over The government tightening just pushed back the timing of the purchase for Chinese buyers said Patrick Chau director of residential sales at property consultant Savills You can never suppress the demand from that market Some developers are also upbeat prompting them to start scaling back some of the incentives previously on offer The citys largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties raised the price of the highend project near Kowloon West by up to 10 percent after a strong market response  it received over 2000 applications for a relaunch of 60 units With the citys healthy 54 percent loantovalue ratio the absence of an immediate interest rate hike and strong purchasing power from endusers and investors Chau expected home prices to rise a further 5 percent by the second quarter of 2014 Here at the

05/20/2014,Insight: Running Chinese finance a different kind of banker, HONG KONGBEIJING  Reuters  The chairman of the worlds most valuable bank was once a good communist learning from the peasants in a collectivist commune in Jiangxi province and working to raise coal production as a teenage miner in Henan during the tumult of Mao Zedongs Cultural Revolution   Today Jiang Jianqing has a somewhat bigger job running the worlds biggest bank Industrial and Commercial Bank of China But he does the work for an annual salary that might make a hardened socialist nod with approval He earned 150000 in 2010 a mere 15 percent of Bank of America Corp CEO Brian Moynihans estimated 10 million pay last year and half again smaller than the 20 million Jamie Dimon was paid for running JP Morgan Like those of his peers at other Chinese banks Jiangs salary has consistently fallen in the past four years from about 240000 in 2008 and he himself said in Hong Kong last year that he hoped his paycheck would stop shrinking We cant be paid more than the regulators who oversee us Jiang explained last year when asked about the matter If the regulators have to take a pay cut we will take a pay cut as well Chinas Big Four lenders are back in the spotlight as Chinas economy starts to absorb the impact of a global slowdown Last week Central Huijin a unit of the 400 billion sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp began buying shares in the banks  ICBC China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China  to prop up their share prices and reassure domestic investors PARTY JOBS As Jiangs example shows Chinas top bank bosses are a different breed to their Western counterparts Beneath their coiffured hair and tailored suits the likes of CCB Chairman Guo Shuqing and ICBCs Jiang are first and foremost Communist Party members appointed to their jobs by the government Chinas biggest financial institutions fall under the supervision of the Communist Party so the bank heads also sit on the partys Central Committee that is ultimately headed by the countrys President Hu Jintao As China prepares for a 2012 leadership transition that will see the retirement of Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao from their party posts many of the bankers will also see themselves rotated into new jobs The Party connections of the Big Four executives raise questions about who exactly they work for Who are you trying to impress Youre not trying to impress your shareholders youre trying to impress party seniors says Patrick Chovanec associate professor at Tsinghua Universitys School of Economics and Management in Beijing After you complete your tour at a bank you will be assigned to a new tour of duty usually in a government posting That bureaucratic outlook has been fully apparent in the banks actions over the years Directed by the state to funnel money into governmentlinked companies banks were saddled with nonperforming loan ratios exceeding 20 percent by the early 2000s Beijing bought out most of those bad loans as the banks prepared for their public listings They have kept a fairly clean record since but many including Credit Suisse and Fitch Ratings warn that bad loans may soon start creeping up again LENDING SPREE Credit Suisse analyst Sanjay Jain said in a report on Wednesday he now thinks that up to 12 percent of all of Chinas outstanding loans may go bad and nonperforming loans may likely account for all of the banks equity Current NPL ratios hover at around 1 percent for the top Chinese banks This comes after banks went on a lending spree during the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 spurred on by Beijings 4 trillion yuan 627 billion call to boost the economy Much of that money went to the railway ministry local governments that set up financing vehicles to fund their pet projects and real estate developers All three are in potential trouble now with the Chinas railway ministry under public pressure after a high profile train crash local governments largely barred from borrowing from banks and property prices in danger of collapsing Despite all that banks have reported strong earnings in the past year that often beat expectations This may be a result of them putting less cash into the kitty to prepare for loans that may go sour This is unlike the late 1990s when the government forced the banks to admit to a huge amount of nonperforming loans This time round the strategy is just to not admit to NPLs said Victor Shih a professor at Northwestern University in Chicago who has written a book on Chinas financial system RED BUSINESSMEN Many of the executives running Chinas banks may have accepted salaries their Western counterparts would disdain in return for the future political appointments that may further their influence said Northwesterns Shih For example the current governor of the Chinese central bank Zhou Xiaochuan and Vice Premier Wang Qishan were both previously head of CCB the countrys No2 lender ICBCs Jiang is rumored to be in the running to head Chinas bank regulatory commission while CCBs Guo is tipped as possibly the next head of the central bank of which he was previously a vice governor Many of them are aspiring politicians and being a bank CEO is merely a stepping stone in their careers Shih said Thus they are willing to accept lower pay Guo Shuqing chairman of the worlds No2 lender China Construction Bank is a philosophy graduate who completed his Masters degree in the 1980s in one of the more fashionable areas of study at that time Marxist and Leninist theory His career path typifies the circuitous route of the senior Chinese bureaucratbusinessman  he was previously vicegovernor of Guizhou province head of Central Huijin director of the State Administration on Foreign Exchange and a deputy governor of the central bank before being named head of CCB Many of these executives were given their jobs after political appointments  Guo in Guizhou and Bank of China Vice Chairman Li Lihui who was vicegovernor of the southern island province of Hainan Others also had regulatory roles with AgBanks lowprofile Chairman Xiang Junbo having once worked at the National Audit Office and Bank of Chinas Li at a local branch of the countrys central bank The irony is not lost on Chinawatchers some of whom say that for all of Chinas claims of being a marketoriented economy many of its biggest companies retain strong relationships with the government Its all decided by the personnel department of the Communist Party said Tsinghuas Chovanec These postings should be seen as precisely that they are postings to give them experience and put them in management roles he said These are not traditional banking paths And unlike most other executives where jobhopping between companies is common few top Chinese executives have ever made the jump from the world of statebacked lending to foreignrun banks or financial services companies despite the promise of higher salaries It could make a lot of sense if knows the American system said a former senior Chinese banker who knows CCBs Guo personally But I think when youre that high in the system and then have to

05/15/2014,BP gets $4 billion from Anadarko for oil spill costs, LONDON  Reuters  Anadarko Petroleum Corp will pay BP Plc 4 billion toward cleanup and victim compensation for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill The amount is less than BP might have won in court but it softens the blow of overall spillrelated costs to the British group   As part of the settlement announced on Monday Anadarko also said it will no longer pursue allegations of gross negligence against BP It is unclear what impact this development will have on the remainder of the morass of litigation pending in federal court in New Orleans legal experts said Investors greeted the deal as good news for both companies BP shares rose 22 percent in London and Anadarko shares closed 55 percent higher at 7444 on the New York Stock Exchange We maintain our view that the ultimate cost to BP could fall  substantially below the cost inferred by the share price fall since the accident said Richard Griffith an oil analyst at Evolution Securities Anadarko based in Woodlands Texas was a 25 percent partner in the doomed Macondo well It sued BP in April claiming that gross negligence by BP caused the blowout and saying that BP is responsible for economic losses from the incident BP in turn invoiced Anadarko 61 billion for spillrelated costs it calculated Anadarko owed The settlement announced on Monday is favorable for both companies BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said Without a deal Anadarko could have been on the hook for 25 percent of the cost of cleanup compensating those affected and any government fines BP has said the total bill for the oil spill including fines will be 42 billion This suggests Anadarko could have faced a total bill well above the 4 billion it agreed to pay It could only avoid this responsibility by proving in court that BP had been grossly negligent  something that could have added around 18 billion to the total amount of fines BP faced Fines for leaking oil into US waters are assessed at 1100 per barrel or 4300 if gross negligence is proven The government has said the Macondo well leaked almost 5 million barrels into the sea Anadarko would still be liable for its share of any fines payable to the US government according to the deal Anadarkos 4 billion payment will be made in cash and paid into the victims compensation fund BP established last year Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen said On October 12 the US offshore drilling regulator  the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement  formally issued violation notices against BP Transocean and Halliburton for their roles in the oil spill BP received most of the 15 citations ranging from failure to protect health and property to failing to keep the well under control A report the previous month found BP solely responsible for 21 of 35 causes of the disaster BP has sued Transocean the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig Halliburton Co which supplied cement to cap the well and Cameron International Corp which designed the blowout preventer a device that was supposed to stop the surge of oil to share the cost of the spill and cleanup These lawsuits are among hundreds of claims set to go to trial before a federal judge in New Orleans in February It is unclear what impact the Anadarko settlement could have on these disputes legal experts said Perhaps the deal creates some momentum toward other settlements because it suggests BP is willing to resolve claims said Howard Erichson an expert in complex litigation and a professor of law at Fordham University But Im not sure it gives Transocean or Halliburton any particular reason to revise whatever calculations they have made A Halliburton spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said It is time for BP to step up and make good on its contractual responsibility to defend and indemnify its subcontractors If BP recoups cash from Transocean or Halliburton it will pay a portion of this  up to 1 billion  to Anadarko under the terms of the deal announced on Monday In May BP agreed to accept 11 billion from a third partner in Macondo Mitsui  Co to cover its 10 percent share of cleanup costs The following month Weatherford International Ltd which provided equipment for the Macondo well agreed to pay BP 75 million The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon US District Court Eastern District of Louisiana No 210md02179 Reporting by Tom Bergin and Moira Herbst Editing by  Andrew Callus   Tim Dobbyn  and  Matthew Lewis

05/12/2014,Philips TV deal at risk plans 4500 job cuts, Reuters  Philips Electronics has all but abandoned hope of selling its TV business by the end of the year leaving a question mark over how quickly it can divest its lossmaking problem child   The global TV market has deteriorated and obviously the sooner we complete this the better but we first need to finalize the negotiations and whether we can do that this year or into the first quarter of 2012 there are some uncertainties with that planning Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters on Monday Philips  the worlds biggest lighting maker a top three hospital equipment maker and Europes biggest consumer electronics producer  said negotiations to sell off most of its TV business to HongKong based monitormaker TPV were intense constructive and taking longer than expected For the eventuality that a final agreement cannot be reached Philips will consider its alternative options van Houten said in a statement on Monday Van Houten told reporters the companies were still talking but if negotiations were finalized it could then take months to close a deal due to regulatory hurdles Both Philips and TPV said on Monday there was no agreed timeline to close the deal Van Houten also said it was too early to outline a backup plan for the TV business which makes up less than 10 percent of group sales and has gone from being a global leader to a drag on the Dutch company The unit has notched up almost 1 billion euros in losses since the beginning of 2007 when competition with lower cost Asian rivals began to intensify The TV negotiations are taking longer than expected and theres no final agreement which is a clear negative said Rabobank analyst Hans Slob That Philips says the negotiations are intense doesnt sound very good either and it looks like there is a clear chance they wont strike a deal Slob added Other analysts have said managements tone and language suggest the TV deal is just delayed and could still happen but perhaps at a higher cost Certain details and terms of the deal which were initially agreed upon and which took into account the global TV market will be under pressure now that the underlying flat screen TV market has weakened significantly said Sjoerd Ummels an analyst at ING Clearly what we dont want is Philips to say they cant sell the TV business and they intend to restructure it while they look for another buyer or just close it down said a Londonbased analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity On Monday Philips reported falling thirdquarter profit due to higher restructuring and raw material costs and sluggish European growth and said it would focus on operational and overhead cuts as part of its 800 million euro cost saving plan Philips said it would aim to cut 4500 jobs as part of the restructuring scheme to boost profit and meet its financial targets That is about 37 percent of its nonTV workforce of just over 120000 which had already been reduced by a 2009 program to cut 6000 jobs Despite reiterating the firms 2013 financial targets of 46 percent sales growth and a margin on earnings before interest tax and amortization EBITA of 1012 percent Van Houten said Philips had a long way to go We are not yet satisfied with our current financial performance given the ongoing economic challenges especially in Europe and operational issues and risks We do not expect to realize a material performance improvement in the near term he said in a statement The firm reported thirdquarter net profit of 76 million euros down from 524 million euros a year ago on sales of 5394 billion euros down from 546 billion euros Analysts in a Reuterscommissioned poll had expected thirdquarter net profit of 538 million euros on sales of 5341 billion euros The Dutch firm halved its thirdquarter earnings before interest tax and amortization EBITA to 368 million euros down from 648 million euros a year ago just beating analyst expectations for 334 million euros Higher restructuring and acquisitionrelated charges as well as higher raw material costs weighed on the firms earnings at its entertainment and consumer lighting units Philips made a shock 13 billioneuro secondquarter net loss on writedowns at its lighting and healthcare units due to weak consumer demand in Europe and North America so analysts were not surprised by the third quarter results In the past seven months Philips has issued two profit warnings slashed its longterm growth targets and been hit by the combination of lowcost Asian rivals rising raw material costs sagging consumer confidence sluggish construction markets and government budget cuts in the healthcare sector Philipss shares which have tumbled almost 40 percent over the year were trading up 145 percent at 1508 euros at 1037 GMT Philips competes with Samsung and LG Electronics among others in consumer electronics and with General Electric and Siemens in the hospital and lighting markets

has become an emblem of the automakers turnaround under Mulally So when workers at the Wayne plant voted to reject a proposed fouryear contract negotiated by the United Auto Workers union it registered as a jarring slap to the CEOs vision for a unified company he calls One Ford I think theyve finally pushed us to the point that we have to do something said Kevin Branham a 49yearold metal finisher at the plant This vote its a matter of people speaking out The Ford contract seemed set for ratification after UAW leaders stepped up their lobbying for the deal By Sunday the yes votes had accounted for 62 percent of all those cast But the surprisingly fierce debate over proposed fouryear contracts at Ford and smaller rival Chrysler Group LLC over the past week has exposed a rift between lowerpaid entrylevel workers and veterans as well as anger over CEO pay The argument over wages and benefits for 67000 unionized Ford and Chrysler autoworkers comes just two years after the Obama administration intervened to save General Motors and Chrysler from liquidation The gratitude that many Detroit workers felt just after the bailout has given way to a frustrated sense that bluecollar workers have not shared equally in the industrys comeback There is a lot of anger at Ford right now and also a lot of anger at the union said Brandon Gustafson a 40yearold assembly line worker at a Ford plant in Minnesota slated for closure just before Christmas With the national unemployment rate stuck at around 9 percent and the risk of a renewed economic downturn UAW officials led by President Bob King have said the proposed contract is the best they can get Last month General Motors workers ratified their own fouryear deal by a 21 margin But the debate over parallel deals at Ford the strongest of the Detroit automakers and Chrysler the weakest has turned bitter A final ratification vote tally is expected by Wednesday for Ford and later this month for Chrysler WAIT UNTIL 2015 In union halls and on Facebook UAW officials have said that rejecting the Ford contract would risk a strike where workers would take home only 200 a week By contrast the Ford contract would give workers 16000 in bonuses over four years including 6000 at ratification Many veteran Ford production workers are unhappy with the lack of a base wage raise since 2003 they now make about 28 an hour Mulallys compensation including a 2010 package worth 265 million has also been a flashpoint workers say We know Ford is profitable said Scott Houldieson secretarytreasurer of UAW Local 551 which represents the Ford Chicago assembly plant that makes the Explorer SUV and the Taurus sedan We know they are paying their executives handsomely We know that a decent wage for us would not hurt Fords bottom line Another sore point Many Ford workers had hoped the contract would resolve a grievance over pay that salaried employees received but hourly workers did not An arbitrator is expected to decide on the issue in midNovember Analysts have said the contract at GM and the proposed deal with Ford would cap costs and link the pay of bluecollar workers more directly with performance But there is a risk for investors that the kinds of deals negotiated in recent months will not hold up in 2015 when workers at GM and Chrysler will have won back the right to strike Wait until 2015 when the chains come off one Chrysler worker wrote on the unions Facebook page The undercurrent of frustration stood out at Fords Wayne plant where the automaker invested 550 million for retooling at the peak of the auto industrys crisis in 2009 The bet at the time was that a once wildly profitable hub for fullsize SUVs could be made over to produce the small Focus and a batterypowered electric variant Ron Andrus 56 a Wayne worker said many at his plant were on edge over the prospect of a strike Its all scary as to whats going to happen he said Some union officials have suggested workers direct their anger to the national economic debate The UAW has endorsed the Occupy Wall Street protest and helped stage an Occupy Detroit rally The Ford workers are angry for the same reasons a lot of the people are here said Jaron Garza a UAWrepresented General Motors worker as he stood in a downtown Detroit park with more than 1000 others in support of the Occupy Wall Street protesters A lot of the bigger companies banks and whatnot have been taking and the middle class has been bearing the brunt of the recession and the aftershocks that we are still feeling now Garza said People are angry and they think theyve got something coming Shares of Ford were down 16 percent at 1138 at midday on Monday The stock has lost 32 percent since the start of the year Chrysler is controlled by Fiat SpA Shares of Fiat are down 30 percent this year

04/25/2014,U.S. bank accounting rule has big earnings impact, Reuters  A 19 billion accounting gain by Citigroup more than half of the 38 billion net income it reported for the thirdquarter highlights a controversial accounting rule that analysts say is adding volatility to many large banks reported earnings   They expect it to continue to be a factor as more banks report earnings in the coming weeks Last week JPMorgan Chase  Co reported an identical gain Other banks that use the same accounting treatment include Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley Bank of America HSBC Barclays and many German banks according to Moodys senior credit officer and bank accounting specialist Donald Robertson The rule allows banks to value some types of assets and liabilities on a marktomarket basis In the case of JPMorgan and Citigroup a weakening of the banks debt relative to US Treasuries is what has led to these reported gains As their debt lost value it became cheaper for the banks to retire the debt if they chose to do so The chance to retire debt at a price below its issue price produced the gain Citi and JPMorgan are reporting and the boost to reported earnings It just creates noise when trying to compare one bank to another said Moodys Robertson The rule makes it harder to compare companies because banks have wide discretion on how they apply it They can use it on financial liabilities with some exceptions including deposit liabilities or deferred tax liabilities Or they can use it only for certain individual instruments and not for others Its a degree of latitude that makes it difficult to compare one bank with another and to predict how big an impact it will have on a bank prior to its reported earnings Once a bank chooses to use the rule it must stick to mark to market valuation until the liability in question expires or otherwise disappears UNIVERSALLY DESPISED This is the most vilified accounting rule Ive ever seen Its amazing how universally despised it is said Robert Willens author of the Willens Report which analyzes corporate accounting and tax matters It does have some supporters however and they argue that the rule highlights valuable information that otherwise would be absent from quarterly reports In Citibanks case it is the bond markets view that its bonds are getting riskier There is good information in these gains Jack Ciesielski an independent accounting analyst and publisher of The Analysts Accounting Observer told Reuters by email They are telling you the degree of faithlessness existing in the bond market for these companies The fact that we see them in a big way for the first time since the credit crisis is disconcerting he said In practice analysts tend to knock these figures out of their earnings analysis arguing that a gain or loss this period may be reversed in the future said Ciesielski and that the figures dont pertain to ongoing profitability Of the 1000 banks Moodys tracks globally about 70 use this accounting including many of the largest banks Robertson said Moodys analysts strip it out of their earnings figures With controversy swirling rulemakers are considering changing the rule according to Robert Stewart a spokesman for the Financial Accounting Foundation an overseer of rulemaking for US accounting The original aim of the rule which went into effect November 2007 was to address the mismatch between assets which financial companies often carry on their books at fair market value and liabilities carried at cost Stewart noted Reporting by Nanette Byrnes in Chapel Hill North Carolina and  Dena Aubin  in New York Editing by Steve Orlofsky
04/24/2014,"Euro zone eyes yet another ""comprehensive strategy""", BRUSSELS  Reuters  A cloud of gloom hangs over Brussels ahead of yet another summit to thrash out yet another comprehensive strategy to tackle a sovereign debt crisis that Europe has failed for two years to stem and that now threatens the world economy   Gallows humor was rife among the grandees of European integration at the annual conference of the Friends of Europe thinktank on the state of the union last week Hopefully next year we wont be talking about Greek debt Etienne Davignon 79 a Belgian former European Commissioner and patriarch of the European project joked in his closing remarks Either it will have gone or we will have gone The opening session was billed as The EUs three ages rise decline and fall The question mark was the only concession to hope Weary cynicism surrounds next Sundays October 23 summit of the 27 EU leaders their sixth attempt this year to draw a line under the euro zone crisis that has led to bailouts of Greece Ireland and Portugal and is now singeing Italy and Spain They trumpeted a comprehensive response back in March but due mainly to German caution adopted a catalog of halfmeasures described by British Prime Minister David Cameron last week as a bit too little a bit too late In July with bond market contagion spreading for the first time to Italy the euro zones third biggest economy leaders of the 17nation single currency area agreed on a second bailout for Greece involving voluntary writedowns for private bondholders and more powers for their EFSF rescue fund Traders quickly spotted that the accord would take months to implement and might be derailed in any of the 17 national parliaments that had to approve it or by Greeces failure to achieve its fiscal targets Confidence evaporated Spanish and Italian borrowing costs were driven so high that the European Central Bank had to intervene in emergency in August to buy those countries bonds and force yields down After weeks of bruising debate first in the German then in the Slovak parliament and haggling with Finland over its demand for collateral on Greek loans the beefedup 440billioneuro European Financial Stability Facility is finally ready to act But the goalposts have moved in the meantime The situation has deteriorated and more radical action is now required MOVING TARGET Greece has strayed off course again and doubts about whether it will ever be able to repay its debts have hardened as the country has slumped deeper into recession and public resistance to austerity measures has mounted Germany and its north European allies are demanding that private bondholders be made to contribute more toward a second rescue for Greece but still on a voluntary basis with no losses for taxpayers or the European Central Bank The talk now is of building a firewall around Greece and convincing investors that other euro zone sovereigns are safe without another ghastly round of ratifications in member states The key elements in the latest comprehensive strategy are reducing Greeces debt and giving it longer to recover bolstering European banks ability to absorb losses leveraging the rescue fund to prevent contagion to larger economies and launching steps toward closer euro zone fiscal integration Yet there is scope for each of these elements to fall short or be overtaken by events especially with the economic growth outlook darkening as austerity measures cripple demand Greek debt relief may be too small to avoid a hard default Banks may struggle to raise capital and governments fearful for their own credit ratings may equivocate about what to do if they cant raise it on the markets Policymakers hope to stabilize the euro zone bond market by using the EFSF to offer partial loss insurance to investors buying new Spanish or Italian bonds This may not be enough to restore confidence if Italys chaotic politics compounded by the economic slowdown thwart austerity plans Markets are bound to test Europes defenses Further credit ratings downgrades could exacerbate the crisis If Frances AAA rating were pulled into doubt due to the capital needs of its banks heavily exposed to peripheral euro zone debt then the entire rescue strategy could falter With so many ifs the chances of this comprehensive strategy being the one that does the trick are anything but certain Pressure for decisive action from other major economies which dominated last weekends G20 finance chiefs meeting in Paris may improve the Europeans chance of success The worlds treasuries and central banks are so alarmed at the risk of a financial meltdown that they may be ready to pile in to support even a shaky European plan European policymakers still reject the nuclear option of a mandatory restructuring of Greek debt which would trigger a credit event with the payment of default insurance and send a shockwave through the financial sector Instead private bondholders face a bigger voluntary writedown of up to 50 percent while euro zone governments and the ECB are shielded from losses on Greek debt to avoid a public backlash that would make further rescue measures impossible It is easier for European politicians to support banks that are unable to raise private capital than it would be to admit they had poured taxpayers money down a Greek hole Radical solutions such as using the ECB as Europes lender of last resort or issuing joint euro zone bonds are politically taboo in Germany Barring such gamechangers expect the euro zone debt crisis to rumble on and on

04/23/2014,Kinder Morgan to buy El Paso for $21 billion, NEW YORKHOUSTON  Reuters  Kinder Morgan Inc  KMIN  struck a 21 billion deal to buy rival El Paso Corp EPN combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America in a huge bet on the fastgrowing market for that fuel   The cash and stock deal announced on Sunday values El Paso at a 37 percent premium to its Friday market value and comes as Exxon Mobil Corp  XOMN  and other oil majors are spending billions of dollars to develop and produce shale gas and crude oil in areas with poor infrastructure The combined El Paso and Kinder Morgan would own about 80000 miles of pipe stretching from coast to coast and could demand higher transport fees from oil and gas producers which could then raise the prices that power companies and other end users pay for gas Now that KMP is by far the biggest pipeline distributor of natural gas that will also give them pricing power over the market which could lead to price pressure to the upside for natural gas said Chris Jarvis president and founder of Caprock Risk Management in Rye New Hampshire We expect this to have a positive impact on the natural gas markets likely setting the stage for addition mergers and acquisitions in the space It was not immediately clear how regulators would view the deal Kinder Morgan said it expected the deal to close in early 2012 Despite weak natural gas prices production of the fuel has been rising as energy companies pile into shale fields  underground formations rich in oil and gas In the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas where there are scant pipelines companies are having to rely on trucks and are building rail terminals to handle the vast fields output El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline system in North America with more than 43000 miles of pipe The combined company would own 67000 miles of natural gas pipe and another 13000 miles of pipelines to move refined products and other fuels We believe that natural gas is going to play an increasingly integral role in North America Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Richard Kinder said in a statement We are delighted to be able to significantly expand our natural gas transportation footprint at a time when it seems likely that domestic natural gas supply and demand will grow at attractive rates for years to come Kinder Morgan went public in February after CEO Kinder and private equite partners including Carlyle Group CYLUL and Goldman Sachs Incs  GSN  buyout arm Highstar Capital and Riverstone Holdings took the company private in a management led buyout in 2007 The private equity firms sold a 135 percent stake in the companys IPO but Kinder and the buyout funds still hold a vast majority of the company SPLITUP DERAILED The deal derails El Pasos plan announced in May to split into two publicly traded companies which would have separated its exploration and production business from its pipeline operations Kinder Morgan said it plans to sell El Pasos exploration and production assets The 2687 per share offer consists of 1465 in cash 04187 Kinder Morgan shares  valued at 1126 per EP share  and 0640 Kinder Morgan warrants  valued at 096 per EP share  based on Kinder Morgans closing price on Friday The warrants will have an exercise price of 40 and a fiveyear term Including El Pasos debt the deal tops 38 billion making it the second biggest merger in 2011 behind ATT Incs  TN  39 billion deal to buy Deutsche Telekoms  DTEGnDE  TMobile USA according to Thomson Reuters data Kinder Morgan said it has a commitment letter from Barclays Capital underwriting the 115 billion in cash required for the transaction The deal also highlights the advantages that energy infrastructure companies have gained in recent years by using a financial structure known as master limited partnerships MLPs which pay no corporate taxes but distribute the lions share of their profits to invsetors and the general partner through dividends Companies like Kinder Morgan  which owns nearly all of its assets through its MLP Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  KMPN   have a tax advantage over their competitors and have also received higher valuations from investors This gives it a financial leg up over a company like El Paso which still holds a substantial amount of its assets outside of its MLP El Paso Pipeline Partners  EPBN  Tudor Pickering analyst Brad Olsen said that the takeover mirrors Energy Transfer Equitys  ETEN  more than 5 billion deal for pipeline company Southern Union SUGN Its not a coincidence at all that the two big pipeline deals done this year have been by big MLPs with decelerating growth Their general partners have gone out and snagged undervalued pipeline assets Olsen said Moreover Kinder Morgan said it plans to pay down much of the substantial amount of debt it is picking up from the takeover by selling off El Pasos assets to its MLPs The new company hopes to generate 350 million a year in cost savings or about 5 percent of the combined companies earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization Kinder Morgan expects to be able to increase its dividend after the deal closes due to these savings It said that if the deal were to close at the beginning of 2012 it would expect to be able to pay a dividend of about 145 a share that year But because it expects the deal to close later it said its dividend will likely be slightly below that target Evercore Partners  EVRN  and Barclays Capital  BARCL  advised Kinder Morgan on the deal while Morgan Stanley  MSN  advised El Paso Goldman Sachs  GSN  acted as an adviser to El Paso on its previously announced spinoff and related matters to the Kinder Morgan deal the companies said The advisors are set to rake in a total of 100 million to 145 million in MA fees according to Freeman  Co

04/16/2014,"U.S. not ""trying that hard"" on exports: GE's Immelt", NEW YORK  Reuters  The United States is not trying hard enough as a nation to win business overseas and that is contributing to its economic slump said General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt   That is a big concern since boosting exports is one of the best ways the nation can tackle the stubbornly high unemployment that is leading a growing number of Americans to question how well the economic system is working Were not trying that hard Immelt told a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event in New York on Monday We havent really tried as hard as we can to compete educate and sell our products around the world and I think we can do better Still the head of the largest US conglomerate and a top adviser to the Obama administration on jobs and the economy believes the United States can improve He noted that GE expects to generate 60 percent of its sales outside its home country this year He held out Germany  home to one of GEs biggest rivals Siemens AG  as an example of a wealthy country that has been successful in pushing exports Chancellor Angela Merkel flies from Berlin to Beijing theres 25 German CEOs that go on the plane right behind her And they connect the dots They play hard they play to win Immelt said President Barack Obama he added has been out driving and pushing to try to double exports in the next five years I think we can compete very well But were not allin the same way that the Germans are allin The nations economic malaise now in its third year has left many Americans angry and frustrated Immelt said and people in power need to empathize Unemployment is 91 percent Underemployment is much higher than that particularly among young people that dont have a college degree Immelt said It is natural to assume that people are angry and I think we have to be empathetic and understand that people are not feeling great A large and diverse group of protesters who complain that the US economic system is no longer working to the benefit of a large slice of the nations population has been a visible presence on Wall Street for a month now The movement known as Occupy Wall Street has spread around the country The protesters complain that the billions of dollars the US government spent during the recession to prop up financial companies including GE have allowed banks to earn large profits without benefiting average Americans GROWTH THE ONLY ANSWER The head of the worlds largest maker of jet engines and electric turbines said he regarded stronger growth as the only real answer to the rising disillusionment The only way to solve this specific problem is growth Immelt said If unemployment comes down people will feel better If unemployment goes up people will feel worse no matter what goes on  Wall Street Immelt said the gap between the pay of CEOs and average Americans is adding to tensions The discrepancy is certainly one of the problems today in terms of why people feel the system is unfair Immelt said But he said that lowering CEO pay would do little to lower unemployment Immelt received compensation worth 214 million last year including a 4 million bonus that was his first since 2007 If CEO pay goes way down and unemployment is 12 percent people are still going to feel bad he said It is a symptom but it is not the problem Immelt is confident that US business can compete with rivals in emerging markets such as China and also profit in developing markets He cited Russia as a major focus over the next decade and said GE is also investing in resourcerich African countries including Mozambique Angola Nigeria and South Africa GE expects to generate more than 60 percent of its revenue outside the United States this year Analysts on average expect it to record revenue of 14813 billion SEES SLOW EUROPEAN GROWTH Concerns that Greece could default on its debt and threaten the European and US financial systems have rattled the world economy in recent weeks pushing down stocks and prompting big banks including Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase  Co to begin laying off staffers The most likely case is that Europe has slow growth for a long period of time Immelt said The process is going to have to be solved inside of Europe Last week the White House advisory panel Immelt heads submitted a report to the Obama administration saying that attracting more foreign capital being more aggressive in energy policy and investing in infrastructure could help create jobs in an economy struggling with high unemployment Immelt a lifelong Republican has drawn fire from some GE shareholders for his work with the Democratic Obama administration The CEO defended his role saying GE executives have long had a voice in Washington People need to try he said Id rather be in the arena trying than not doing what I can to help Partisanship in Washington is hurting the nations economy by slowing efforts to reform the system Immelt said adding that he worried that antiWall Street rhetoric hurts people other than those it is aimed at If your first comment is Wall Street is horrible and youre in a position of leadership you dont hurt Wall

04/04/2014,Berlin tempers summit hopes banks under pressure, DUESSELDORF Germany  Reuters  Germany said on Monday that a summit of EU leaders next Sunday would not produce a miracle cure for the euro zones sovereign debt crisis a warning that pushed down markets after a rise in the past week on expectations of a breakthrough   German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a conference in Duesseldorf that European governments would adopt a fivepoint plan at the Brussels meeting to address the turmoil that has clouded the outlook for the global economy This is expected to include a plan to recapitalize banks and reduce Greeces debt mountain by asking the countrys private creditors to accept steeper writedowns on their holdings than the 21 percent losses agreed last July But Schaeuble cautioned that the meeting would not yield a definitive solution for the crisis that started in Greece two years ago and has since spread across the 17nation bloc leading some experts to predict a breakup His comment weighed on the euro which fell one percent against the dollar after hitting a onemonth high earlier in the day European stocks also fell Ahead of a 48hour general strike in Greece that is expected to bring the country to a standstill just as parliament votes on a new set of controversial austerity measures Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou appealed for unity This is maybe the most crucial week for Greece and Europe he said during a meeting with the Greek president Hours later however a deputy from Papandreous party quit his seat in protest against what he called unjust steps The lawmaker will be replaced by another socialist so Papandreous fourseat majority in the 300strong assembly is unchanged Greeces overall debt is forecast to climb to 357 billion euros 4914 billion this year or 162 percent of annual economic output  a level economists agree is unsustainable To reduce this mountain euro zone leaders are racing to convince banks to accept voluntary writedowns of up to 50 percent on their sovereign holdings At the same time they are trying to agree on a blueprint for recapitalizing financial institutions at risk from the deepening crisis Determining how the writedowns will be applied and the source of funds to recapitalize the banks will require arduous negotiations between now and the deadlines the EU has set for itself said Dan Morris global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management We remain optimistic an agreement will be found but returns have been so strong over the last few weeks there is a risk of disappointment if it takes longer to work out the details than investors expect LITTLE CHOICE Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance IIF a lead negotiator for the banks told Reuters that bigger writedowns could only happen if policymakers addressed broader sovereign debt issues in Europe If the official community is interested in asking the private sector to take another look at Greece then it will have to be only as part of a broader process of addressing the full range of sovereign debt issues in Europe Dallara said Privately bankers say addressing Greeces problems alone will accomplish little They are pushing policymakers to come up with a stronger plan for addressing the woes of the entire euro zone fearful that governments might come back with new demands in a matter of months if their latest steps fail One solution under discussion is leveraging the blocs 440 billion euro rescue fund  the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF  to give it more firepower But it is unclear whether Germany and other northern European members of the currency bloc will agree to this EU officials say the banks have little choice but to accept voluntarily the losses requested by governments since the alternative would be a disorderly default that would trigger wider financial market chaos and bigger writedowns European finance ministers will meet on Friday to prepare the EU summit Sources told Reuters that they would consider a threepronged plan for shoring up banks which have restricted interbank lending in the crisis exacerbating market worries The plan foresees a higher minimum capital requirement for banks an additional temporary buffer for those exposed to troubled euro debt and a requirement that banks have adequate term funding even if this means statebacked guarantees Leading German and French banks have said they will resist forced recapitalizations but the French government made clear on Monday that this is what policymakers wanted French banks will be recapitalized even though they are solid because we are in a climate of extreme nervousness extreme tension and lack of confidence so we must strengthen all the banks French government spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse said on French radio We are going toward a collective European solution she added We will ask all European banks to have 9 percent capital ratios by 2013 to be more solid to face risk The deadline Pecresse mentioned was much later than EU officials have suggested They want banks to be given three to six months to reach the target German Chancellor Angela Merkels spokesman said the government was working intensively to define how German banks would participate in a second rescue package for Greece and how to make best use of the EFSF But like Schaeuble he cautioned against high expectations Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy promised last week that they would unveil a new comprehensive plan by the end of the month boosting investor hopes The chancellor has pointed out that the dreams building up that this package will mean everything will be solved and over by Monday cannot be fulfilled spokesman Steffen Seibert said In Portugal another debtridden euro zone country that was granted an EUIMF bailout in May a draft budget bill forecast that a recession will worsen next year as the government adopts severe austerity measures to rebuild the countrys finances The draft presented on Monday foresees the economy contracting 28 percent in 2012 compared with a 19 percent slump this year Lisbons centerright government presented the

04/03/2014,Exclusive: Memo to Fox Business staff - don't copy Fox News, NEW YORK  Reuters  Heres a novel idea Fox Business Network should focus on covering business news   At least thats what Kevin Magee executive vice president of the News Corpowned cable news network is urging his staff to do Unhappy with Fox Business focus on politics Magee fired off a memo to employees reminding them that the network was not created to be a light version of its sister Fox News Channel Ive been asked to remind you all again that they are separate channels and the more we make FBN look like FNC the more of a disservice we do to ourselves Magee said in the memo dated October 5 carrying the subject line Fox News and Fox Business I understand the temptation to imitate our sibling network in hopes of imitating its success but we cannot Magee went on to say in the memo If we give the audience a choice between FNC and the almostFNC they will choose FNC every time Earnings taxes jobs etc give us PLENTY to chew on Fox Business which was launched in October 2007 with 100 million in initial capital sought to take Wall Street to Main Street by covering business stories for ordinary people  seeing a market as CNBC and Bloomberg Television cater primarily to financial professionals But four years on Fox Business Networks ratings remain far behind those of CNBC  a disappointing performance in comparison with Fox News which in four years rose to top thenmarket leader CNN and has reigned ever since In an interview with Reuters on Monday Magee confirmed sending the memo and said that heading into the US presidential election next year it was worth restating the importance of Fox Business finding its own voice and audience There is always going to be overlap between economics and politics but we need to maintain two separate services Magee said We can cover the political angle but our focus should be on our charter of gaining and producing wealth Magee said he decided to send the memo after a conversation with Roger Ailes chairman and CEO of Fox News Channel and chairman of the Fox television stations group Ailes ran CNBC until 1996 GROWING PAINS The launch of Fox Business Network was part of News Corp chief Rupert Murdochs plan to dominate coverage of global business news following the acquisition of Dow Jones  Co Inc publisher of the Wall Street Journal Murdoch at the time said he was considering launching versions of the network in other countries and planned to invest 300 million over the next three years by which time FBN would overtake CNBC in ratings The first part of Murdochs goal has been achieved with versions of Fox Business available in Japan and Italy But so far the network has been unable to seriously challenge much less eclipse CNBC in the ratings Rupert wants a competing news network to CNBC not another Fox News said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity Right now its obvious they dont cover enough financial news According to ratings agency Nielsen which only began measuring the networks daily audience in March Fox Business averages 76000 viewers from 600 am to 430 pm during the week From 430 pm to 800 pm its audience grows to 85000 before falling back to 56000 during the primetime hours of 800 pm to 1100 pm By comparison CNBC averages 263000 viewers from 600 am to 600 pm and 206000 viewers in primetime during the week Nielsen said the audience for Bloomberg Television is too small to meet its minimum reporting threshold There were huge expectations that Fox Business would eclipse CNBC in the ratings that thus far have not come to fruition said Brad Adgate senior vice president for research at Horizon Media On News Corps quarterly earnings call in August Murdoch said Fox Business now breaks even on a cash flow basis which meant that while it does not make any money it is no longer losing any either He also noted that there have been times when Fox Business has beat CNBC headtohead in the ratings Magee said that ratings fluctuate because business news is seasonal and often eventdriven with higher viewership during earnings or the debt ceiling negotiations for instance Overall he said he was very pleased with Fox Business ratings growth noting that the networks audience is up nearly 40 percent yearoveryear Fox Business audience could also benefit from gaining access to Wall Street Journal journalists who have been under an exclusive contract with CNBC that expires next year BRAND IDENTITY Part of the reason Murdoch wants Fox Business to focus on financial news is because he believes it will help widen distribution of the network according to the source Fox Business is available in about 58 million homes compared with the more than 90 million homes that CNBC reaches In theory more carriage should equal higher ratings and more advertising dollars CNBC is owned by NBC Universal a unit of Comcast Corp and General Electric Magee said Fox Business is currently

it   As it gets harder for them to walk some find hip or knee replacement surgery a compelling option But many of Tongues patients have another worry one that is causing some to delay treatment and live with the pain awhile longer We have more people who are anxious about losing their jobs if they have elective surgery They are anxious about returning to work said Tongue who practices near Portland Oregon referring to the time they would need to take off to recuperate He does up to 400 procedures a year With 14 million Americans searching for work lack of health insurance is one reason some people are putting off medical procedures such as joint surgery For those who do have jobs and insurance the fear of being expendable at work combined with sticker shock from rising outofpocket expenses is a deterrent to getting care Some older patients are even waiting until they are eligible for the governmentfunded Medicare program at the age of 65 They are concerned about higher deductibles and costs They want more information about what their total bill will be if they have the procedure Tongue said Were seeing people trying to put things off until they get to Medicare with the impression that they will have a lower cost As the economy struggles to avoid recession sales of medical devices such as artificial hips and knee joints are expected to remain sluggish into next year The new projections confound expectations by companies that had bet a recovery would come earlier on the assumption that patients could not wait too long for treatment Some could reset their forecasts as they report quarterly financial results starting this week analysts said People are putting off any sort of nonacute nonsymptomatic care Even if it is symptomatic until it becomes acute they are not taking the time to come in said Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang Especially if unemployment stays at 9 percent a lot of folks are going to clench their teeth and ignore the pain A NEW NORMAL FOR HEALTHCARE Some analysts have scaled back growth forecasts for the big orthopedic and cardiac device makers in recent days throwing in the towel on hopes for a modest pickup in demand next year A report by Ernst  Young last month cited a new normal for the medical device industry extending a term more often tied to credit card use or discretionary shopping patterns In healthcare that shift is partly based on patients turning down treatment when they question its necessity New US government and congressional investigations into unnecessary procedures as well as patient complaints incomplete safety data and several highprofile device recalls have also grabbed media headlines in the last two years We no longer expect a procedural rebound in 2012 said Mizuho Securities analyst Michael Matson Analysts estimates still assume some sort of recovery next year and that isnt going to happen Matson cut his forecast for hip and knee procedure growth in 2012 to 1 percent from his prior expectation for growth of 3 percent a field led by Johnson  Johnson Stryker Corp and Zimmer Holdings For the spine device market  a major business for Medtronic Inc and others  he now expects flat volume next year down from his previous forecast for slight growth of 1 percent The slowdown is being felt beyond orthopedics in specialties ranging from urology to cardiology Morningstars Wang expects volumes in one of the industrys top markets  implanted heart defibrillators  to decline by 2 percent to 4 percent affecting Medtronic and rivals Boston Scientific Corp and St Jude Medical Inc two large healthcare companies with significant device businesses as well as Intuitive Surgical Inc Stryker St Jude Boston Scientific and Baxter International Inc all report quarterly earnings this week Expectations for many medical technology companies in the third quarter have already been lowered to reflect the ongoing weakness in surgical procedure volumes with the focus now turning to companies projections for 2012 According to research from JP Morgan which keeps a database of 8000 US physicians office visits in September declined 8 percent from a year ago following a 7 percent drop in August and a 4 percent slump in July Visits in the third quarter fell to the lowest level since the bank began collecting data in the first quarter of 2008 and mirror a dropoff in US consumer confidence Device makers are also under pressure with the implementation of a US healthcare overhaul which is expected to bring cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates for hospitals That means doctors and other healthcare providers are likely to  take an even harder line on the pricing and use of medical technology With an aging population and more baby boomers approaching retirement age physicians and analysts alike believe some bounceback in procedures is inevitable If you need a hip replaced you are going to get a hip replaced eventually Otherwise you are going to be in a wheelchair said

fiscal fever despite forecasts that failure to resolve the federal budget standoff could be catastrophic   The benchmark SP 500 is up more than 3 percent for September which has traditionally been described as the worst month for stocks and was just 2 percent off its alltime high Part of the calmness comes from the fact that investors have seen this before said Ryan Detrick senior technical

which is often seen as the place to offset risk and make protective bets against a decline in the stock market there is little or no volatility premium priced in for the debt ceiling debate A growing number of market participants are even viewing the battle in Washington as an opportunity to jump into equities Every situation weve had like this over the past few years has been a buying opportunity This is just another wrinkle not a time to change your strategy said Andres GarciaAmaya global market strategist at JP Morgan Funds in New York with 400 billion in assets under management During the federal government shutdown from December 15 1995 to January 6 1996 the SP 500 added 01 percent During the November 13 to November 19 1995 shutdown the benchmark index actually rose 13 percent according to data by Jason Goepfert president of SentimenTradercom OPTIONS SUGGEST LITTLE RISK While the cost of insuring against a US default on Friday crept higher the price of put options on the SP 500 the most popular hedging strategy against a decline on the benchmark index is near its lowest level since the financial crisis We looked at options prices for the SP 500 as well as stocks with the highest revenue exposure to government finding that relatively little fear is priced in said Goldman Sachs in a note to clients on Thursday Complacency is even more pronounced on stocks with high government exposure Fear priced into options on these stocks dropped over the past few months to new lows versus the SP index options With just one trading day to go before the end of the third quarter the stock market could see heightened volatility on Monday as money managers adjust their positions to improve the look of their portfolios or windowdressing If a government shutdown is avoided Wall Street will focus next week on the critical September jobs report expected on Friday After the Federal Reserve decided to keep its stimulus efforts intact investors will scrutinize the report for a better sense of when the central bank may begin to reduce the size of its bondbuying stimulus program The jobs situation is still the biggest driver for the market and the Fed needs to see better data to pull the trigger said GarciaAmaya Data next week include Chicago PMI and the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey due on Monday The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing and construction spending reports are due on Tuesday followed by the ADP privatesector employment report on Wednesday Weekly jobless benefits claims data will be released on Thursday Additional reporting

09/18/2013,EU watchdog wants to charge foreign clearing houses, LONDON  Reuters  The European Unions markets watchdog wants to charge foreign clearing houses seeking to cash in on new derivatives rules being introduced across the 28country bloc an EU document showed on Saturday   The move is a sign of how hardpressed regulators are struggling to implement on time a welter of reforms called for by world leaders during the financial crisis One set of new rules being phased in aims to make derivatives like credit default swaps and interest rate swaps safer after taxpayers were forced to bail out banks in 2008 that held large amounts of them But the Parisbased European Securities and Markets Authority ESMA has asked the European Parliament in a letter seen by Reuters if it could levy an undisclosed fee on clearing houses also known as central counterparties or CCPs from outside the EU Clearers ensure that derivatives and other financial transactions are completed even if one side of a deal goes bust and are core to making the opaque 630 trillion swaps market more transparent and safer Regulators are forcing banks and others to channel swaps transactions through clearing houses raising the prospect of a big new revenue stream ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor said in the letter dated September 24 that the watchdog will have to vet each foreign clearing house that wants to operate in the EU But this task will be much more burdensome than originally expected and with significant budget implications the letter said It had anticipated seven foreign clearers to request authorization during this year and next but the watchdog has already received applications from 34 nonEU clearing houses none of which was named in the letter Europes top EUbased clearers include LCHClearnet  LSEL  and Eurex Clearing  DB1GnDE  but are set to face competition from foreign rivals seeking to benefit from the new clearing requirements now being phased in Maijoor said this will involve a significant amount of work about 45 days per application or about 7 extra officers European taxpayers should not pay for allowing third country CCPs to freely offer their services within the EU Maijoor said Fees disincentivise unsubstantiated applications that is incomplete inaccurate and spurious applications European clearing houses are generally subject to fees when they apply for authorization abroad Maijoor added Reporting by Huw Jones editing by  David Evans

09/16/2013,Analysis: Shutdown default threat elevates appeal of U.S. Treasuries, NEW YORK  Reuters  Government shutdown Federal default These looming political threats to the US economy might scare investors to buy more US Treasuries in the coming days as they seek a shelter for their cash   While a protracted government shutdown and particularly a default could harm to the image of Uncle Sams debt its safehaven appeal looks unchallenged in the short term Worried about rising chances that federal workers and contractors wont get paid if much of the government shuts down on October 1 amid a political standoff in Washington investors are expected to go by the conventional crisis playbook  dumping assets perceived to be higherrisk and rushing into those seen as lower risk An extended shutdown which would include furloughs and temporary unpaid leave for many government employees would have a direct impact on businesses who rely on government contracts or spending by government employees It could also lead to delays in spending on bigticket items by companies and consumers as confidence takes a hit That could all harm economic growth and make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will curb its stimulus program through bond buying further supporting prices of government debt Congress must also raise the federal borrowing authority by October 17  when the government is expected to exhaust its 167 trillion debt limit Failure to do so could threaten a debt default but many analysts think the government would slash spending before declining to pay its creditors leaving Treasuries relatively unscathed at least initially Analysts said a riskaversion move could push benchmark yields on 10year notes below 250 percent more than 050 of a percentage point below the twoyear high above 3 percent set in early September Late on Friday they were trading at about 263 percent Its paradoxical that a government shutdown or hitting the debt ceiling is good for Treasuries but you most likely would see a flighttosafety into Treasuries said Bill Cheney chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston INVESTOR CONFIDENCE Any fears about a protracted government shutdown havent been reflected in recent trading This month Treasuries are likely to post their first gain in five months as the sector recovered from its summer swoon sparked by the Federal Reserve decision last week to maintain its bond purchase program Growing demand for some Treasury obligations that mature before the October 17 debt limit deadline knocked their interest rates to below zero this week A month ago they traded at 002 percent The yields on benchmark 10year Treasuries have already fallen to their lowest levels in six weeks partly on safehaven bids on bets about a possible government shutdown next week Still a longlasting government shutdown or even worse a default could harm the Treasuries market You dont want to damage investor confidence in US Treasuries said Craig Dismuke chief economic strategist with Vining Sparks in Memphis Tennessee If there is a flighttosafety it would a temporary one Ironically the wrangling between President Barack Obama and Republican lawmakers over the budget the debt ceiling and the Affordable Care Act  also known as Obamacare  was renewed at a time when the US fiscal picture has improved this year Higher tax receipts even in this sluggish recovery have helped lower the federal deficit and reduced the governments borrowing needs PAST LESSONS Washington last shuttered government offices and stopped paying workers for five days in November 1995 and then from midDecember 1995 to early January 1996 The yield on the 10year Treasury notes ended that year at 576 percent down from 788 percent at the beginning of the year The yield had begun falling earlier that summer after the Fed started cutting interest rates in July More than 15 years later under the threat of a federal default the 10year yield has fallen 06 percentage point from just above 3 percent in three weeks during late July to early August of 2011 when Republican lawmakers and President Barack Obama were also bickering over raising the debt ceiling In the derivatives market back then traders ratcheted up their bets on a US default The price of thinlytraded credit default swap contracts which might have paid out if the US government missed its debt payments for an extended period jumped to 62 basis points which was the highest since the worst days of the global credit crunch according to data firm Markit This meant an investor would have paid 62000 euros a year to insure 10 million euros worth of Treasuries against a default within a fiveyear period The contract is denominated in euros to offset the impact of a default on the US currency On Friday the price on the fiveyear CDS on US Treasuries was nearly 32 basis points the highest since May It is difficult to predict what might transpire the coming days Looking at history there is not a clear pattern said Cheney at John Hancock The 1995 government shutdowns barely interrupted a Standard  Poors 500 indexs  SPX  winning streak It ended up 34 percent that year In contrast the SP tumbled 14 percent in the summer of 2011 during the first debt ceiling fight between Obama and the Republicans and following Standard  Poors stripping of the United States AAArating Investors stampeded into Treasuries from stocks While many still expect that the White House and Republican leaders will come up with temporary fixes to avert a government shutdown and a default analysts said there is some nervousness given that political leaders have remained far apart We are conditioned for an 11th hour deal but you cant take anything for granted said Eric Green global head of rates currency and commodity research at TD Securities in New York If Washington were able to keep the government running and paying its bills the 10year yield will likely rise back to around 275 to 280 percent It would also allow Wall Street to focus on whether the economy is showing any signs of picking up steam and the timing of the Feds bond buying pullback analysts said The Fed tapering is way more important than all of this Cheney said Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by  Martin Howell  and  Tim Dobbyn

07/10/2013,Best Buy CEO sets goals; Wall Street begs for more details, Reuters  Best Buy Co Inc  BBYN  hopes to triple its operating margins over time the company said on Tuesday though investors and analysts were left wanting for details on how  and how soon  the new chief executive would turn around the worlds largest consumer electronics chain   The aggressive new targets come as Best Buy faces cutthroat competition from online and discount retailers like WalMart Stores Inc  WMTN  and Amazoncom Inc  AMZNO  CEO Hubert Joly got a difficult reception at an investor day in New York as people questioned whether management was focusing too much on wringing higher sales out of existing customers rather than attracting new ones Joly was named CEO on August 20 I still think I am a little bit mixed on digesting the takeaways of the presentation I think they said a lot of good things but I think people were looking for a little bit more of a playbook and the next steps said John Tomlinson an analyst with ITG Investment Research in New York Theres a lot of pieces to the fixing story that seemed a little opaque and vague Best Buys stock closed nearly 1 percent lower at 1570 on Tuesday continuing a slide that has knocked off a third of the companys market capitalization this year The stock touched a 10year low of 1439 a week ago Dimitri van Toren senior portfolio manager at Dutch asset manager Syntrus Achmea which holds about 200000 Best Buy shares said he was worried about structural issues and a management vacuum at the retailer but that he would stay in the stock despite concerns about the upcoming holiday season The meeting took place against the backdrop of a potential buyout offer from founder and former CEO Richard Schulze who is expected to make an offer as soon as next month I spend no time worrying about what our corporate structure will be Joly told reporters after the event I tend to focus on decisions I can influence rather than decisions I cant influence A representative for Schulze did not immediately respond to a request seeking his thoughts on Jolys plan Joly said it would have been ridiculous to offer more concrete details after only a few weeks on the job He said this meeting was more about setting the record straight and reassuring investors about the companys future The perception was that Best Buy was dying Joly said MARGIN TARGETS In a statement on Tuesday the company said its shortterm goal will be to stabilize and then begin increasing its comparablestore sales and operating margin Over time it is aiming for a return on invested capital of 13 percent to 15 percent in addition to a 5 percent to 6 percent operating margin target In the last fiscal year Best Buy had an operating margin of about 21 percent The last time that margin exceeded 5 percent was in the fiscal year that ended in early 2008 Joly said a mixture of excessive costs and price competition hurt margins and that the retailer would turn to a wider variety of highermargin privatelabel products to boost results One example is the companys own Insigniabrand electronics Best Buy has been struggling to combat a phenomenon known as showrooming where people visit its stores to look at products and then buy them online for less Joly acknowledged the company has suffered from a price perception issue among customers that it needed to address as well as weakness in its online operations The head of the companys digital business said its online conversion rate  which measures how successfully Best Buy translates customer visits into actual sales  was only about half of what it should be Many of these problems are a result of our own making Joly said during the investor presentation HOLIDAYS COMING Best Buy also said on Tuesday that it would pursue a plan to optimize its store footprint on an ongoing basis which suggested the company may look at ways to shrink or close stores as some other bigbox retailers have done In late March the company said it would close 50 large US stores Joly warned that merely closing stores would not boost operating income as most of the bigbox stores are already profitable Relocation to smaller space may be an option however he said 71 percent of the largeformat stores have leases expiring within the next six years The details of Jolys longawaited plan came roughly a week before the unofficial start of the years biggest selling season The retailer which has posted declines in samestore sales in eight of the last nine quarters warned last month it expected earnings and samestore sales to fall again in the third quarter I am already sick and tired of negative comps Joly said referring to samestore sales figures The CEO also admitted a number of past investments have not paid off and promised the new leadership would be prudent about that in the future a nod to Wall Streets lingering concerns about spending by past management Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan in New York

07/03/2013,Analysis: U.S. credit rating could again take hit in 2013, NEW YORK  Reuters  In 2011 the United States emerged from a damaging budget battle with a downgrade of its pristine tripleA rating for the first time in history In 2013 it could be dealt even a bigger blow   The battle over avoiding the socalled fiscal cliff is the first of a likely series of partisan confrontations in Washington in the coming year that if not resolved could cause more downgrades of the US credit rating The rating is in the hands of policymakers said John Chambers chairman of Standard  Poors sovereign rating committee the agency that downgraded the United States in August 2011 In interviews with Reuters since the November 6 election all three major rating agencies said cutting the US debt rating  still among the worlds strongest  is highly likely if next years budget process replays 2011s debt ceiling debacle or if the seemingly simple goal of cutting deficits goes unmet Should that happen it could have a detrimental effect on the countrys cost of borrowing and could also shift some investment away from the United States though the countrys big markets and attractiveness as a safe haven are likely to limit those effects In the absence of a sustainable coherent mediumterm vision for the US federal budget which has produced deficits above 1 trillion in each of the last four years the rating will fall The fiscal cliff is one step in that process but the possibility of a downgrade will still loom over Washington throughout the year If no budget deal is reached in the early part of next year and the debt trajectory just continues to rise  then wed be looking at a downgrade of a notch to Aa1 said Bart Oosterveld managing director at Moodys sovereign risk group Automatic spending cuts in January coupled with significant tax increases could take an estimated 600 billion out of the US economy and push it into recession according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Offices assessment of the fiscal cliff The effects will be gradual but significant with the unemployment rate possibly rising to 9 percent If Congress goes over the cliff Moodys said it will watch how the economy deals with the abrupt shock and will maintain the current negative outlook it holds on the United States Ultimately if Congress and the president cant reach a deal to stabilize and eventually reduce the debt now at 16 trillion Moodys will probably cut the United States current Aaa rating Fitch meanwhile said even a deal to avert the cliff might not be enough to save the countrys AAA rating Temporary measures to stave off the budget shock without a credible strategy for the years beyond could earn the country a downgrade said David Riley managing director for sovereign ratings at Fitch Were going to find out over the coming months if that a compromise will be the case or not Riley said There isnt that much time The country needs a combination of increased revenue and reduced spending Riley said That plan needs to be bipartisan and credible over the mediumterm he added calling a cliffinduced recession wholly unnecessary Rating agencies will also be watching talks on raising the debt ceiling next year SP cut the United States to AAplus from AAA on August 5 2011 blaming bitter debt debates that threatened to plunge the country into default and Republican obstruction during a process that was for years a formality If the same happens this time Riley said Fitch could slash its rating during the first half of the year That could cause more turmoil for uncertain markets The last time we faced this and the politicians played shenanigans with the debt ceiling and we were downgraded it mattered in the sense that it led to a lot of volatility and a loss of confidence said Julia Coronado chief North America economist at BNP Paribas in New York BEST OF A BAD LOT When SP cut the United States last year markets reacted badly The benchmark SP 500 index  SPX  slumped the Monday following falling 67 percent to an 11month low Paradoxically US Treasury yields plunged as spooked investors stampeded to safe havens The yield on the benchmark 10year note fell to 232 percent on August 8 from 256 percent on August 5  and is now around 16 percent That same kneejerk response could be repeated Investors need to hold billions and billions of dollars said Andrew Wilkinson chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak  Co Where else are they going to go Noise out of a rating agency is not going to change that Thats particularly the case with the euro zone in continued turmoil The areas threeyearsandcounting debt crisis is still far from resolution Certainly the dollar has no challenger as the key international reserve currency Chambers said SP having cut the rating last year now could wait until the end of 2014 for another cut Chambers said Investors will likely have plenty of time to digest a downgrade Notably countries that lose their AAA status typically take years to claw their way back to the top rating SP downgraded Australia in December 1986 and it took until February 2003 for its tripleA to be restored Canada took from 1992 to 2002 Denmark was cut to AAplus in 1983 and didnt get upgraded back to AAA until 2001 Theres because sovereign cuts at the AAA level are relatively rare coming on issues that take years to resolve Its not really about the downgrade said Jeff Rosenberg BlackRocks chief market strategist for fixed income Its about whats occurring in the environment around that time period thats creating the momentum for the analysts to downgrade Still theres a reason why countries lose top ratings only with difficulty If the United States does indeed hold onto its AAA from Fitch and its Aaa from Moodys  and its onenotch lower rating of AAplus from SP  it could happen because the worlds biggest economy proves its resilience once again When youre looking at the US from this side of the Atlantic you say the outlook looks quite good compared to the UK and the rest of Europe Fitchs Riley said US gross domestic product is expected to rise at a 22 percent annual rate in 2013 compared with 03 percent annual growth in the euro zone and 11 percent in the United Kingdom according to Thomson Reuters If you can resolve this gridlock in Congress and provide some clarity theres probably upside to the US economy

07/02/2013,Exclusive: Astenbeck Clive funds slide as fiscal cliff hits oil, Reuters  Astenbeck Capitals Andrew Hall and Clive Capitals Chris Levett  two of the biggest fund managers in oil  are in for a second year of losses unless they can steer a turn around the next six weeks in a market bogged down by US fiscal worries   Weighed down earlier in the year by Europes debt crisis oil now faces economic uncertainty from the socalled US fiscal cliff  a convergence of urgent tax and spending issues in 2013 that if mishandled by opposing lawmakers in Congress could plunge the economy into another recession On the positive side crude prices have been supported by Irans controversial nuclear program and unyielding violence in Syria which has started to affect some of its neighbors in the oilproducing Middle East These have led to whipsaw volatility in Londons Brent and US crude futures with fund managers often at a loss on whether to short the market on economic concerns or go long on worries about supply disruption Brent the more important benchmark of the two is trading almost flat for the year at just above 108 a barrel US crude meanwhile is down nearly 14 percent hovering at 85 Hall one of the markets most famous bulls says hes confident prices will rise over the long run on seasonal supplydemand But hes not sure about the near term particularly the next six weeks IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST Geopolitical risks remain high although it is impossible to forecast how events will unfold the billionaire oil trader told Astenbecks investors in his monthly letter for November a copy of which was obtained by Reuters Astenbeck and Clive had taken opposite sides of the market earlier this year resulting in contrasting fortunes for their investors But their performances have converged of late Losses at the two funds are also small enough to allow them to rebound if their managers read the market correctly The largely oilfocused Astenbeck  based in Westport Connecticut and managing 46 billion  is down 2 percent for the year through October according to confidential performance and other data on the company obtained by Reuters Last year the fund finished down nearly 4 percent  handing Hall his first ever annual loss as a trader This year Astenbeck emerged from a bruising second quarter  it lost 14 percent in May in its worst month ever as Europes crisis worsened  to post three months of profit through September But it stumbled again last month as crude prices slipped on fears about global growth In Clives case the Londonbased hedge fund with 33 billion under management is down about 3 percent for the year said investors in the fund who asked not to be identified Last year it lost almost 10 percent Other energy hedge funds havent been doing too well either As of Tuesday HFN Indices a database run by New Yorks eVestment Alliance reported that 11 of the 36 funds on its energy sector index were up by just 1 percent on the average through October NOT SHY TO SHORT Levett previously a star commodities trader at Louis Bacons Moore Capital founded Clive in 2007 running it with partner Richard Boland Unlike Hall whos almost perpetually bullish about oil the 42yearold Levett is not shy about shorting the market when he thinks there is little upside to the price say investors familiar with his trading style As a fund they said Clive also appeared less energycentric than Astenbeck  investing in natural gas and metals such as copper tin and lead  although some of its biggest positions have been in oil Exact bets taken by the two funds as well as how much exposure they had particularly to oil was not known Hedge funds typically do not speak about their performance or operations to the media and both Astenbeck and Clive did not comment for this story Investors said Clive gained about 7 percent some 230 million in May  versus Astenbecks 14 percent loss  after betting correctly on the tumble in oil prices that month But in July it fell 3 percent or nearly 100 million as the market went against Levetts short positions Data this week from the IntercontinentalExchange which trades in Brent crude oil showed speculators including hedge funds trimming their net long positions for a third straight week But figures from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed a rise in net longs of both combined futures and options of Brent and US crude BET THE RANCH Astenbeck named after a centuryold castle in Germany owned by Hall was launched in 2008 after Halls decadelong storied career as a Citigroup  CN  oil trader who earned controversial bonuses worth hundreds of millions of dollars Aside from the hedge fund the 61yearold Hall also runs Phibro Trading a commodity trading firm largely owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp  OXYN  If youre in oil now isnt the time to bet the ranch But Andy Hall might just be the guy to do that said Charles Gradante cofounder of New Yorks Hennessy Group which invests in commodity hedge funds although not with Astenbeck and Clive I know some managers are paring their oil positions because they fear politicians will allow the market to be seized up by the fiscal cliff before a solution comes If you have billions in capital and youre down just 2 percent you could load up in this lesscrowded market But youre also less nimble than the smaller guy and less likely to get out quickly in a crash Reporting By Barani Krishnan Editing by  Bob Burgdorfer

06/20/2013,"Fed officials see need to replace ""Twist"" in 2013", WASHINGTON  Reuters  A number of Federal Reserve officials in October felt the US central bank would need to step up asset purchases in 2013 to fill the gap when Operation Twist expires according to minutes released on Wednesday that hardened expectations the Fed will take such a decision next month   The minutes of the US central banks policy meeting last month also showed that officials looked favorably on the idea of adopting unemployment and inflation thresholds to guide expectations about when they would eventually raise interest rates but felt this needed more work Under the program dubbed Operation Twist the Fed has been selling shortterm securities to buy 45 billion in longerterm debt every month to push down longterm borrowing costs The program is slated to expire at year end A number of participants indicated that additional asset purchases would likely be appropriate next year after the conclusion of the maturity extension program in order to achieve a substantial improvement in the labor market the Fed said in the minutes of the October 2324 policy meeting Wall Street traders had already expected the central bank to replace Operation Twist in 2013 and analysts said the minutes simply provided another reason to expect a decision to do so at the Feds next meeting on December 1112 This reference underscores the dovish bias at the Fed and it reinforces our basecase expectation for the Fed to continue its current Operation Twist Treasury purchase profile beyond December Millan Mulraine senior US macro strategist at TD Securities in New York wrote in a note to clients HAWKS NOT SILENT In addition to Operation Twist the Fed is purchasing 40 billion in mortgagebacked securities each month in its third and latest round of quantitative easing dubbed QE3 Unlike Twist which swaps shortterm debt with longterm debt QE 3 expands the Feds balance sheet Most analysts expect any Twist replacement would do the same The Fed has turned to asset purchases and balance sheet management techniques to try to give the US recovery an extra push since its main tool for influencing the economy  the overnight federal funds rate  was dropped to near zero in 2008 With the jobless rate at a lofty 79 percent the Fed has said it would employ its tools until the labor market improves substantially and it has pledged to keep an easy policy in place even after the recovery gains traction Fed Vice Chair on Tuesday delivered a reminder of the central banks progrowth tilt saying that an optimal path for policy indicated rates remaining near zero until early 2016 At the Feds October meeting the chief of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank Jeffrey Lacker was the only policymaker to vote against the decision to continue with monthly purchases of mortgagerelated debt But the minutes made clear he was not the only official worried about the Feds aggressive actions Several participants questioned the effectiveness of the current purchases or whether a continuation of them would be warranted if the recent moderate pace of economic recovery were sustained the minutes said THRESHOLDS The Fed has said it expects to hold rates near zero until at least mid2015 but several officials have suggested replacing this calendar commitment with a set of economic variables or thresholds that would signal when the time to raise rates was drawing near Many participants were of the view that adopting quantitative thresholds could under the right conditions help the committee more clearly communicate its thinking about how the likely timing of an eventual increase in the federal funds rate would shift in response to unanticipated changes in economic conditions and the outlook the Fed said However it said a number of other officials believed a qualitative description of what was driving the Feds thinking could be even more informative Yellen in her speech on Tuesday said she strongly supported the idea of coming up with numerical guidelines While her influential backing showed the seriousness with which the Fed was pursuing the idea the minutes made plain that more work was needed Participants generally agreed that the policy committee would need to resolve a number of practical issues before deciding whether to adopt quantitative thresholds the minutes said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told staff to do more work on the proposal Reporting by Alister Bull Editing by  Neil Stempleman   Tim Ahmann   James Dalgleish  and Leslie Adler

06/12/2013,Analysis: Amazon faces new obstacles in fight for holiday dollars, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Amazoncom Incs  AMZNO  gift for dominating the holiday shopping season may lose some of its magic this year   The countrys biggest brickandmortar retailers from WalMart Stores Inc  WMTN  and Target Corp  TGTN  to Toys R Us TOYSUL are gunning for Amazon competing more aggressively on price and offering speedier delivery through sprucedup websites and stores that double as distribution warehouses The onslaught comes as Amazons price advantage over physical retailers is being whittled down The company began collecting more sales taxes this year in Texas Pennsylvania and California probably raising prices unless Amazon swallows the increase These drivers are definitely placing added pressure on Amazon this year more so than in the past said Eric Best chief executive of Mercent which helps merchants sell online The final quarter of each year encompassing Thanksgiving and Christmas is vital for retailers because thats when they generate the most revenue and a big chunk of their profits Amazon through lower overhead efficient inventory management and better product selection and search has dominated online purchases during the season Now Amazon itself appears to acknowledge the threat to its holiday crown or at least the uncertainty engendered by resurgent competition During a recent conference call with analysts it forecast fourthquarter operating results ranging from a loss of 490 million to a profit of 310 million  far wider than last year when it predicted a result that ranged from a loss of 200 million to a profit of 250 million Amazon ended up making 260 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 Theres increased competition from mass merchants and bigbox retailers embedded in that guidance said RJ Hottovy of Morningstar You could see margins somewhat challenged this season Im not expecting blowout numbers from Amazon in the fourth quarter An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment To be sure these rival efforts may only dent Amazons online holiday preeminence The company has cost advantages over physical stores and it sells off inventory quicker This is a crucial edge in the retail business because unsold inventory is effectively stagnant money that could be used to generate more revenue and profit elsewhere Amazons Prime shipping service is a magnet that will draw in holiday shoppers again this year The company is spending heavily on new fulfillment centers nearer to big urban centers speeding up delivery times to make the service more attractive But 2012 could turn out to be the year when retailers slow Amazon down The competitive headwinds are certainly blowing said Colin Sebastian an analyst at RW Baird We expect Amazons topline growth rate to moderate a bit RETAILERS IMPROVE Matt Nemer an analyst at Wells Fargo said big retailers have made lots of small improvements such as better product search faster website speeds and slicker mobile sites The big retailers are in a much better space than they were last year Nemer said WalMart the worlds largest retailer has probably made the most progress online the analyst added It launched a new search engine for Walmartcom this year that has led to shoppers being 10 to 15 percent more likely to purchase after searching for products on the site according to WalMart WalMart also recently started sameday delivery tests in San Francisco San Jose Northern Virginia Philadelphia and Minneapolis using some of its 4000 stores as distribution centers for quicker shipping of online orders In the spring the retailer started a Pay with Cash program that lets shoppers without credit cards order online and pick up in stores The biggest impact on Amazon is going to be retailers that have truly figured out how to combine the best of digital and physical worlds said Darrell Rigby head of Bain  Companys Global Retail Practice PRICE WARS ONLINE Hottovy said programs from companies such as Target Best Buy Co  BBYN  and eBay Incs  EBAYO  PayPal to match online pricing could squeeze industry profit margins including those of Amazon Most analysts see these programs more as a marketing strategy to attract shoppers into stores and stop them going to Amazoncom But behind the marketing blitz retailers are arming themselves to compete better against Amazon on price WalMart developed technology this year that lets the company regularly monitor competitors online prices for every product it sells Other retailers are using similar technology known as dynamic pricing offered by thirdparty companies including Mercent which lets them change online prices many times a day Mercents Best estimates industry adoption of dynamic pricing is growing at about 75 percent a year He declined to say which retailers are using the service Retailers used to change prices once every one or two weeks but during the 2010 holiday season prices began changing daily for the first time according to Best By 2011s holiday season hourly price changes became more common We are seeing pressure from customers to change prices more frequently than an hour There is so much riding on this holiday season Best said during a recent conference call with analysts Online pricing tools like this are the basic building blocks to being competitive Nemer said Meanwhile Amazons collection of sales tax in some big states brings its price advantage over physical stores down to roughly 3 percent to 5 percent from 5 to 10 percent according to Hottovy Amazon was pushed into collecting more sales tax as cashstrapped state governments seek additional revenue But in return it can now build new fulfillment centers in those states speeding up deliveries and reducing shipping costs A recent online survey of more than 400 Amazon shoppers in California conducted by SurveyMonkey found that 36 percent said they would shop there less because the retailer started collecting sales tax Most of those shoppers said they would shop at other online retailers that do not collect California sales tax More than a quarter said they would shop at retail stores instead according to the survey STORES AS WAREHOUSES Retailers are also competing more with Amazon Prime which offers free twoday shipping in the United States as part of a 79 a year or 799 a month subscription Prime customers often go to Amazoncom first to buy gifts for the holidays to make sure they are getting the most out of their subscription In WalMarts sameday delivery test this holiday shoppers pay a 10 flat fee to have online purchases of televisions toys and other general merchandise sent to them from nearby stores EBay is testing sameday delivery of online orders from stores of retailers including Target Best Buy and Toys R Us in San Francisco this holiday Most Toys R Us stores are also part of the companys Ship from Store program which taps instore inventory to fulfill online orders Retailers may get a profit margin boost if they can route online orders to stores that have a lot of a particular product in stock This could help them avoid costly markdowns by rebalancing store inventory Nemer explained Fulfilling online orders from the store is the most important thing that will change physical retailers over the next five years Nemer said Reporting by Alistair Barr editing by

06/03/2013,Best Buy CEO sets goals; Wall St begs for more details, Reuters  Best Buy Co Inc  BBYN  is aiming to achieve operating margin of 5 percent to 6 percent over time the company said on Tuesday though investors and analysts were left wanting for details on how  and how soon  the new chief executive would turn around the worlds largest consumer electronics chain   The aggressive new targets come as Best Buy faces cutthroat competition from online and discount retailers like WalMart Stores Inc  WMTN  and Amazoncom Inc  AMZNO  CEO Hubert Joly got a difficult reception at an investor day in New York as people questioned whether management was focusing too much on wringing higher sales out of existing customers rather than attracting new ones Joly was named CEO on August 20 I still think I am a little bit mixed on digesting the takeaways of the presentation I think they said a lot of good things but I think people were looking for a little bit more of a playbook and the next steps said John Tomlinson an analyst with ITG Investment Research in New York Theres a lot of pieces to the fixing story that seemed a little opaque and vague Best Buys stock closed nearly 1 percent lower at 1570 on Tuesday continuing a slide that has knocked off a third of the companys market capitalization this year The stock touched a 10year low of 1439 a week ago Dimitri van Toren senior portfolio manager at Dutch asset manager Syntrus Achmea which holds about 200000 Best Buy shares said he was worried about structural issues and a management vacuum at the retailer but that he would stay in the stock despite concerns about the upcoming holiday season The meeting took place against the backdrop of a potential buyout offer from founder and former CEO Richard Schulze who is expected to make an offer as soon as next month I spend no time worrying about what our corporate structure will be Joly told reporters after the event I tend to focus on decisions I can influence rather than decisions I cant influence A representative for Schulze did not immediately respond to a request seeking his thoughts on Jolys plan Joly said it would have been ridiculous to offer more concrete details after only a few weeks on the job He said this meeting was more about setting the record straight and reassuring investors about the companys future The perception was that Best Buy was dying Joly said MARGIN TARGETS In a statement on Tuesday the company said its shortterm goal will be to stabilize and then begin increasing its comparablestore sales and operating margin Over time it is aiming for a return on invested capital of 13 percent to 15 percent in addition to a 5 percent to 6 percent adjusted operating margin target On a comparable basis its operating margin in the last fiscal year was 47 percent Over the past four quarters the margin was 42 percent Joly said a mixture of excessive costs and price competition hurt margins and that the retailer would turn to a wider variety of highermargin privatelabel products to boost results One example is the companys own Insigniabrand electronics Best Buy has been struggling to combat a phenomenon known as showrooming where people visit its stores to look at products and then buy them online for less Joly acknowledged the company has suffered from a price perception issue among customers that it needed to address as well as weakness in its online operations The head of the companys digital business said its online conversion rate  which measures how successfully Best Buy translates customer visits into actual sales  was only about half of what it should be Many of these problems are a result of our own making Joly said during the investor presentation HOLIDAYS COMING Best Buy also said on Tuesday that it would pursue a plan to optimize its store footprint on an ongoing basis which suggested the company may look at ways to shrink or close stores as some other bigbox retailers have done In late March the company said it would close 50 large US stores Joly warned that merely closing stores would not boost operating income as most of the bigbox stores are already profitable Relocation to smaller space may be an option however he said 71 percent of the largeformat stores have leases expiring within the next six years The details of Jolys longawaited plan came roughly a week before the unofficial start of the years biggest selling season The retailer which has posted declines in samestore sales in eight of the last nine quarters warned last month it expected earnings and samestore sales to fall again in the third quarter I am already sick and tired of negative comps Joly said referring to samestore sales figures The CEO also admitted a number of past investments have not paid off and promised the new leadership would be prudent about that in the future a nod to Wall Streets lingering concerns about spending by past management The story corrects paragraphs 1 12 13 to fix comparison after company said forecast was for adjusted and not GAAP margin Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan in New York Writing by  Ben Berkowitz  Editing by Maureen Bavdek Phil Berlowitz  Matthew Lewis  and  Jan Paschal

05/20/2013,Facebook stock jumps 12.6 percent as share lockup expires, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 percent on Wednesday as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling   While the lockup is expiring there is nothing requiring anybody to sell said Tim Ghriskey chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills New York Given the low price these longterm holders are deciding to hold the stock and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebooks May initial public offering The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921millionshare float available for trading on the market until now Weve seen this before with other lockups People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring and then they have a bit of a relief rally said Ryan Jacob chief executive of the Jacob Funds which does not own Facebook shares In August shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 percent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired That stocks rally was boosted as shortsellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize say analysts Facebook shares finished Wednesdays regular trading session up 126 percent at 2236 on the Nasdaq with trading volume for the stock more than four times the average during the past 50 days The worlds No 1 online social network became the only US company to debut with a market value of more than 100 billion But its value has dropped nearly 50 percent since the IPO on concerns about moneymaking prospects over the long term Insider trading lockup provisions started to expire in August and the rolling expirations have added to the pressure on the stock Restrictions on insider selling have expired in waves A limitation on more than 200 million shares expired on October 29 COST OF SHORTING Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said he did not expect Facebook insiders to sell all of their shares as the lockups expired I would expect heavy volumes over the next few weeks but not undigestible volumes said Wieser By his estimate roughly 486 million of the nearly 800 million newly freed Facebook shares will be sold There is some evidence the heavy interest in shorting the stock was dissipating given the poor performance since it first sold shares in May Investors who believe a stock will fall can bet against it by shorting the stock  that is borrowing it and selling it in the hopes it will decline According to Markit a financial information services company about 28 percent of the shares available for shortselling were being borrowed for that purpose down from a high of more than 80 percent in early August Similarly SunGards Astec Analytics which also tracks interest in shorting noted that the cost of borrowing Facebook shares is down more than 50 percent since the beginning of the month Everything would seem to indicate the market is losing its appetite to short Facebook wrote Karl Loomes market analyst at Astec The cost of shorting Facebook has declined to 018 percent on an annualized basis Astec said on Wednesday By contrast shortly after the IPO the cost to short the stock ranged from 40 percent to 50 percent annually Its become somewhat of a controversial stock It always adds fuel to the fire if you have a sizable short position said Stephen Massocca managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco But the unlock is not new news It doesnt mean everyone is going to sell and it doesnt mean every order is going to come in today Facebook with roughly 1 billion users has faced a tough reception on Wall Street amid concerns about its slowing revenue growth and nascent advertising efforts on mobile devices But the company delivered betterthanexpected thirdquarter results on October 23 and revealed that 14 percent of its advertising revenue is now from mobile ads reassuring some investors it was beginning to figure out how to earn money from smartphone and tablet users They had a pretty good quarter I think a lot of investors though are waiting to see some consistency in the results said Jacob Several members of Facebooks senior management have sold millions of dollars worth of shares in recent weeks through prearranged stock trading plans as lockup restrictions expired Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has sold roughly 530000 shares this month netting just over 11 million though she still owns roughly 20 million vested shares in Facebook In August Facebook board member Peter Thiel sold roughly 400 million worth of Facebook stock the majority of his stake when an earlier phase of lockup restrictions expired Facebooks 28yearold chief executive Mark Zuckerberg

05/09/2013,Abercrombie shares soar as inventory issues wane, Reuters  Teen clothing retailer Abercrombie  Fitch Co  ANFN  stunned investors on Wednesday with unexpectedly improved thirdquarter results and a fullyear outlook that exceeded Wall Street forecasts sending shares up as much as 30 percent   The company got a handle on excess inventories that had sparked a round of discounting that worried investors It also had pockets of sales strength in places like Scandinavia and China that helped revenue exceed expectations Even troubled markets like Spain were not as bad as expected Abercrombie  Fitch was being highly disciplined with inventory management and was working to ensure sales growth outpaced that of inventory Chief Executive Mike Jeffries said on a call with analysts Wednesday The company ended the quarter with total inventory that was 21 percent lower than a year ago Shares of the company which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc  GSN  in September to help ward off pressure from investors were up 28 percent at 40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange The stock has lost about a third of its value since hitting 5756 a year ago Roxanne Meyer an analyst at UBS Securities said the rally in the stock was due to covering of short positions by traders According to Markits Data Explorers about 28 percent of the shares available for shortselling were being borrowed for this purpose Thats more than the market average of about 8 percent though it is down from a peak of more than 70 percent in midAugust Not all shares of a companys stock are available for shorting so a high rate of utilization suggests heavy interest among shortsellers Investors who believe a stock is going to fall sometimes bet on this by borrowing the stock and selling it also known as shorting Aeropostale Inc  ARON  shares also benefited rising 6 percent at 1382 Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange Aeropostale competes on price with Hollister stores which are also owned by Abercrombie Meyer said Wall Street will assume Abercrombies cleaner inventory gives Aeropostale more breathing room from Hollisters discounting But she said that despite the encouraging trends in Abercrombies comparable sales and margins she was neutral on the stock as it seeks clarity in improving fashion Inventory management or balancing orders with demand has been a major concern for Abercrombie In recent quarters it has been compelled to offer discounts to its teenaged clientele who had held back on purchases In the third quarter Abercrombie sales grew 9 percent to 117 billion Markets like Asia Scandinavia Spain and Belgium did well or not as bad as expected resulting in a 37 percent rise in international sales CEO Jeffries attributed the pick up in sales to inventory flow getting back on track I think that international stores benefited as did US stores from flowing new product That was really our problem in the second quarter when we were in the defensive posture and did not flow product appropriately Jeffries said The fact that the company was able to rein in excess merchandise bolstered confidence that Abercrombie will be able to keep up the cost benefits it saw this quarter said Rahul Sharma founder and managing director of retail consultancy Neev Capital Bloated inventories encourage price discounts eroding profit margins CEO Jeffries also said the company was working on shortening the lead time between placing orders to manufacturers and getting them in stores and would focus on current street and runway trends for its merchandise line Over the past year sales at Abercrombie  Fitch have dropped in a segment dominated by socalled fastfashion retailers  rivals with a quicker turnover of inventory and styles such as American Eagle Outfitters  AEON  and Gap Inc  GPSN  or Forever21 which offers affordable clothing for more seasons Abercrombie has moved to curb dwindling sales by boosting sourcing from the United States and Central America and delaying expansion in troubled European markets The retailer expects to earn 285300 a share for the full year Analysts on average expected the company to earn 248 a share according to Thomson Reuters IBES Samestore sales for the third quarter or sales at established stores open at least a year fell 3 percent an improvement over the 10 percent drop in the second quarter The company forecast a midsingledigit drop in samestore sales in the fourth quarter The relatively improved performance doesnt signal the end of Abercrombies troubles analyst Brian Sozzi of NBG Productions said I dont believe Abercrombie is suddenly the share winner in teen apparel land  and I wonder about sustainability of the story and whether they can become trends he said noting that globally the comparable sales at Abercrombies flagship locations were quite poor For the third quarter ended October 27 Abercrombie earned 715 million or 87 cents a share compared with 509 million or 57 cents a share in the same quarter last year Analysts were expecting earnings of 59 cents a share Reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Chicago and  David Gaffen  in New York Editing by  Bernadette

02/04/2013,Surge in U.S. oil-by-rail suffers first slowdown as spreads slim, NEW YORKCALGARY  Reuters  Oil traders are gently tapping the brakes on the thriving business of shipping US and Canadian crude oil by rail industry data showed this week the first sign of a slowdown after a twoyear boom   As price spreads for moving sweet North Dakota or Canadian crude to premium markets on the Gulf Coast slump to their lowest since early 2011 companies are shifting more oil back through pipelines rather than using costlier railcars raising new questions about the longevity of oilbyrail The number of railcars loaded with crude or refined fuel per week in the United States has dropped by about 5 percent since reaching a record 14500 tank cars during May according to Reuters calculations based on data from the Association of American Railroads released on Thursday At 13664 cars through June 8 the latest weeks loadings are still up 28 percent from a year ago equivalent to about 14 million bpd With crude oil estimated to make up about half of all such shipments thats about a tenth of US production Weekly AAR data do not distinguish between crude and refined fuels Still the annual growth rate is much slower than the 50 percent surge since the start of the year In the first quarter alone crude oil shipments jumped by 166 percent to the equivalent of 760000 bpd AAR said last month Since early 2011 traffic has been growing mostly steadily every week Apart from a brief dip in early 2013 this is the first meaningful slowdown since oil companies began reviving a mode of transport that most had abandoned decades ago using the rails to help get a gusher of shale oil production in remote areas not served by pipelines to refiners eager for cheaper oil Most analysts say it is likely to be a temporary lull Some pin it on a reduction in Canadian output due to maintenance and refinery work in the US Midwest They also note that refiners like Phillips 66  PSXN  have signed longterm deals to receive Bakken crude by rail and that there is no excess pipeline capacity in key areas like North Dakota Genscape which uses cameras and infrared equipment to monitor both train traffic and oil pipelines has also seen the switch but believes rail traffic cant drop much further I think the pipelines have come very close to filling back up so the incremental barrels have to move by rail said Brian Busch Director of Oil Market and Business Development Yet the slowdown in rail shipments may unnerve some of the energy companies logistics groups like Sunoco Logistics  SXLN  and tank car manufacturers like Trinity Industries  TRNN  who are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to get in the game and disappoint operators like Union Pacific Corp  UNPN  and Canadian Pacific Railway  CPTO  for whom oil is a small but growing source of revenues If we see the differentials stay tight like this for more than a few months some companies are definitely going to sit up and take notice said Martin King analyst at FirstEnergy Capital in Calgary Sandy Fielden an analyst at consultants RBN Energy said there are signs that lease rates for tank cars are also ebbing It all adds to growing evidence that the US oil market is entering a new phase leaving behind a time when price spreads and trading opportunities were defined by the lack of transportation infrastructure to get booming shale crude to market After a wave of new investment producers now have more options for reaching different markets boosting prices The past 18 months have brought booming business for the rail industry from crudebyrail and every boom inevitably has a bust It remains to be seen if we have reached that point yet he wrote in a report published on Thursday A PAUSE Speculation of a pause after two years of rising oilbyrail shipments has grown since early April as the closely watched BrentWTI price spread fell to less than 10 a barrel That is the lowest since early 2011 when a rapidly widening spread opened up an arbitrage for using costly railway transport to ship the growing volume of Bakken crude to southern markets Yet the downturn in traffic comes just as more and more industry officials and analysts have begun backing the view that moving crude by rail is more than simply a stopgap measure one that will help keep oil flowing until new pipelines are built Increasingly it is being seen as a potentially important longerterm option for producers refiners and traders who can benefit from the flexibility of easily moving any type of crude to almost any refinery on the continent With a pipeline both supply and purchase options are far more limited That may be especially true for refiners on the West and East coasts which lack major pipelines to move crude oil to their regions Canadian producers may also continue to use rail cars particularly those with special heating coils to move heavy bitumen that cant be easily shipped in pipeline Until you see some pipeline plans emerge to move Midcontinent crude to the East or West coasts  which you havent yet  youre going to continue to see rail be viable said Allen Good an analyst with Morningstar Despite widespread optimism over the longterm outlook the collapse in crude spreads this spring has caught many traders by surprise And for the moment its getting worse The spread between Bakken crude at the pipeline hub of Clearbrook Minnesota and benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet fell from nearly 30 in early March to a thenrecord low of around 13 in May Analysts estimate it costs 12 a barrel for the rail journey about three times more than via pipelines This week the spread has dropped to just 6 a barrel after an outage at a Canada sands production unit Reporting by Jonathan Leff in New York Nia Williams in Calgary and Kristen Hays in Houston Editing by Phil Berlowitz

01/02/2013,U.S. shale is a boon to manufacturers but not their workers, YOUNGSTOWN Ohio  Reuters  This city has been down for so long its hard to believe whats risen up here in the heart of Americas Rust Belt   On an industrial site littered with scrap metal a FrenchJapanese joint venture called Vallourec Star has just opened a 11 billion stateoftheart steel pipe mill The plant the largest capital investment by a manufacturer in northeast Ohio since the 1960s and Youngstowns first new steel mill since the 1920s is a big example of the money that has flowed into the states industrial sector in recent years thanks to the surge in US natural gas and oil drilling The uptick in energy exploration has prompted companies like The Timken Co and US Steel Corp to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into their plants in the state to boost production Wayne Struble the policy director for John Kasich Ohios Republican governor said the flood of energyrelated dollars could be a major game changer for the state But state employment data academic research and a weeklong tour of half a dozen factories in Ohio suggests the shale gas revolution has been a disappointment when it comes to job creation The industries benefiting are more capital intensive than labor intensive said Tom Waltermire the chief executive of Team NEO the economic development agency for northeast Ohio Even a manufacturing renaissance wont require the same headcount per unit of output as we had 20 or 30 years ago If it did require that the renaissance would never happen In March a study by Cleveland State University concluded that while gas exploration had unleashed a surge in economic activity in Ohio job growth  even in counties directly affected by the drilling  was stagnant The employment growth that many assumed would follow the energy investment was not yet evident the studys authors said  linkreuterscomqef88t  The Vallourec Star plant for example will employ just 350 workers Those jobs wont begin to make up for ones lost just a year ago when RG Steel closed its plant here and laid off more than 1000 workers  let alone the tens of thousands of jobs Youngstown has lost since the late 1970s when the steel mills that drove the local economy closed And some recent investments like the 100 million Timken put into a new intermediate finishing line at its Faircrest Steel Plant in Canton are resulting in fewer not more jobs Timkens old intermediate finishing line employed more than 200 workers and processed pipe and other products in 10 days according to plant manager Larry Pollock The new facility built to meet surging demand from the energy industry employs fewer than 30 and can process the same material in as little as two hours plant manager Larry Pollock said In the brightly lit and relatively quiet plant no human hand touches the pipes as they speed down the line Workers monitor the process at half a dozen computerized control consoles A lot of the old assets were standalone work centers independently loaded and unloaded very labor intensive Pollock said Data from the states Bureau of Labor Market Information tells the story After bottoming out in 2010 Ohios manufacturing sector has added nearly 42000 jobs in recent years But the state still has nearly 110000 fewer manufacturing jobs today than it did in 2007 when the last recession began Meanwhile pay across the sector is going down not up according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Manufacturing workers in Ohio for instance have seen their wages fall 13 percent in the last year alone In a sign of how the labor supply is far exceeding demand Vallourec Star got more than 20000 applications when it solicited applications for its 350 openings online You can see how hungry people are says Joel Mastervich the companys president and COO HOW LONG WILL IT LAST Despite disappointments on the job front the shale drilling has created a new and lucrative niche business for companies that make the steel pipe compressors and other products energy companies need Pipeline and processing companies operating in Ohio have invested 4 billion in the state in the recent years according to the states economic development agency Its a good time to be selling stuff in Ohio says Jack Lafield the founder and chairman of Caiman Energy which has formed a 15 billion joint venture with Dominion Energy to build plants and pipelines to process gas and nongas liquids The shale boom has already spurred some companies to remake themselves Two years ago sales at American Road Machinery ARM a small metal fabricating shop in Minerva that makes truckmounted snow plows and leaf vacuums were in a tailspin as a result of sharp cuts in spending by cashstrapped municipalities An exceptionally warm winter in 2011 and spring in 2012 added to the companys problems Nick Ballas ARMs president looked around at the flurry of gas drilling in his backyard and asked himself How do we play in this game Today half of ARMs revenue comes from truckmounted vacuum tanks and winches that are hot items with drillers and oil service companies But the oil and gas business is notoriously cyclical and that has Ballas nervous In neighboring Pennsylvania the drilling for shale gas went from zero to full speed to full stop in three years he says as he eyes the half dozen unsold tank trucks parked in his yard A report in midMay from Ohios Department of Natural Resources DNR suggests Ballas has reason to be cautious The report concluded that the states shale deposit was heavy on lowerpriced gas and light on more profitable oil Since the oil and other liquid petrochemicals believed to be trapped here were the big draw for many drillers not the gas itself the report raised questions about just how much demand the industrial companies will actually enjoy as a result of the Ohio shale play  and whether some may have gotten ahead of themselves as they invested to meet expected demand The bigger companies including Vallourec Star US Steel and Timken insist their huge investments in new capacity are justified by the global shale oil bonanza not by the success or failure of any single shale play in the United States We are as excited to see the things that are happening in North Dakota Brazil Singapore and China as we are watching whats going on in Tuscarawas County 30 miles to the south of us says Jim Griffith the CEO of Canton Ohiobased Timken But even before the DNR report Timken said during its firstquarter earnings call that it was already seeing lower demand from oil and gas customers and it warned that it expected the weakness to continue through the year US manufacturers arent the only ones scrambling to supply the shale drillers John Wilkinson is the 36yearold manager of US Steels operations in Lorain just west of Cleveland US Steel recently spent 100 million on the 100yearold plant to build a new line to meet demand from the energy industry The steel industry is back Wilkinson tells Reuters Were starting to see it and its a fantastic feeling But Wilkinson can also tick off the names of the foreign companies that are building new plants to sell to drillers including Tenaris SA controlled by Argentinas Techint group and based in Luxembourg as well as Chinas Tianjin Pipe Group Corp In our tubular market theres a million tons of capacity coming onto the market in the next few years he says Thats what were going to be up against Editing by Patricia Kranz and  Claudia Parsons  This story was refiled to say US

12/18/2012,Britain's treasure islands make G8 tax test for Cameron, LONDON  Reuters  Pitching tougher rules on tax evasion to the G8 is a precarious undertaking for Prime Minister David Cameron Britains own tax havens are world leaders   Britains list of exotic Overseas Territories reads like an accountants dream menu for a cashrich Russian oligarch with something to hide while British lawyers lead the field as gatekeepers for elaborate global mazes of offshore trusts Global tax evasion could be costing more than 3 trillion a year according to researchers from Tax Justice Network while as much as 32 trillion  twice the size of US gross domestic product  could be hidden by individuals in tax havens British tax havens are world leaders in providing a particular type of secrecy said John Christensen an economist who directs the Tax Justice Network and who began investigating offshore havens in 1978 From the families of Asian government officials to the new rich of the former Soviet Union court cases and data leaks have shown many wealthy individuals favor Britains modern day treasure islands as the place to park their millions Tax authorities scouring a huge batch of leaked data said last month that the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands were among those housing shell companies and trusts to hide wealth Once buccaneer havens many of the sleepy former British colonies now live off a blend of beach tourism and exotic finance that activists say leaves both locals and distant taxpayers shortchanged CORPORATE STING Stung by revelations that the likes of Google  GOOGO  and Starbucks  SBUXO  have sharply cut their corporate tax bills in Britain using legal loopholes Cameron has put tax avoidance at the heart of the agenda for the G8 summit No one country can on their own effectively stamp out either tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance and this is exactly the sort of issue that the leaders of the eight major economies should address Cameron said The British leader has focused on trying to get a deal to create a public register on the beneficial ownership of thousands of shell companies and to achieve greater exchange of information between tax authorities Global Witness a campaign group says a public register would be an achievement even if only one or two G8 members signed up as it would help reveal the real owners of the shell companies it describes as the worm at the heart of the apple of all money laundering and corruption But skeptics doubt the effectiveness of such unilateral steps unless the kind of opaque tax structures used by Britains offshore territories are tackled head on We also need a major crackdown on tax havens  the bedrock of global tax avoidance Margaret Hodge Labour chairman of the British parliaments influential Public Accounts Committee PAC wrote in the Guardian this month The prime minister has given us plenty of tough talk about cracking down on tax avoidance Whether he can deliver a concrete agreement will be a crucial test of his leadership TREASURE ISLANDS Cameron has invited Overseas Territories including Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands to London before the G8 summit to try to hash out a deal on international transparency Advisers cautioned that London has little real leverage with the Overseas Territories which sport the Union Jack on their flags and share the British monarch as their head of state However the fact that some of the worlds most high profile tax havens are what some have described as British franchises is seen as complicating Camerons push for coordinated global action The key issue is this delicate dance that needs to be done with the offshore territories and also with the G8 members said Robert Palmer at Global Witness Some campaigners said Cameron should be applauded for raising the tax issue with leaders such as US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin But accountants said getting a deal with teeth may elude him There will be an agreement to look at the issue but thats probably about the best they will get said Bob Rothenberg a senior partner at London accountants Blick Rothenberg Thats a nice general thing but it means nothing The politicians are really hiding behind the corporates in terms of trying to make them feel more socially responsible whilst not grasping the nettle by trying to deal with tax rules in their own countries Rothenberg said Russia Canada Germany and Japan are all believed to be reluctant to make firm commitments at the summit and while the United States has put pressure on nonUS banks for greater transparency some of its states such as Delaware remain a thriving hub for shell companies Its very difficult to land the overseas territories unless you also land the US Thats the challenge the Prime Minister has Palmer said Cameron has not yet publicly mentioned tackling offshore trusts  a vehicle that offshore lawyers pitch as a way to shield assets from tax and any claims from governments or competitors  in relation to the G8 summit Its whats off the agenda rather than what is on the agenda that matters said Christensen It seems clear that Cameron is

12/14/2012,G8 to shy away from naming and shaming corporate tax avoiders: draft, LONDON  Reuters  The G8 group of leading economies will shy away from adopting a measure aimed at curbing tax avoidance by highlighting when companies channel profits into tax havens and will include a watered down alternative according to a draft statement   British Prime Minister David Cameron who is hosting the annual G8 Summit in Northern Ireland next week has said he will put tax evasion and aggressive avoidance at the heart of the meeting Tackling corporate tax avoidance has become a political goal internationally following public anger about revelations over the past year that companies like Apple and Google had used structures US and European politicians said were contrived to minimize the amount of taxes paid But a draft of the communique to be released by the leaders at the end of the summit circulated by Britain and seen by Reuters will not support a rule that would force companies to publish their profits revenues and tax payments on a countrybycountry basis The draft is dated May 21 and will have been subject to change but without a dramatic shift the thrust seems clear The European Commission and tax campaigners back such a measure in the hope that companies would be shamed into abandoning corporate structures under which most of their profits are reported in tax havens where they have few staff or sales The British plan envisages that companies would potentially on a voluntary basis report financial information on every country where they operate to the tax administration in each of the countries We call on the OECD to develop a common template for country by country reporting to tax authorities  including an examination of both voluntary and compulsory approaches the draft said Most countries already have access to such information but it could help some developing countries who have expressed difficulties in accessing information about companies outside their territory which they suspect to be involved in siphoning profits from affiliated companies on their territory However even here the information would be of limited benefit since it would not be sufficient to legally prove abusive behavior Business groups have lobbied heavily against public country by country reporting saying it would be unreasonably burdensome but Sven Giegold member of the European Parliament for Germanys Green Party criticized the failure to adopt the measure This is not the expected breakthrough we had hoped for and may not be solid a step forward he said The G8 declaration offers nothing new on tax Britains finance ministry declined to comment on the draft The UK government has so far declined to support the EU proposal on publishing countrybycountry profits and only said it supports voluntary disclosure by companies The draft communique also included a commitment to create central registries that would contain details of the beneficial owners of companies a move aimed at stopping individuals stashing possibly stolen money in tax havens out of the gaze of tax authorities The communique says these registers would be accessible to tax authorities and law enforcement agencies but tax campaigners had called on the registers to be made public Giegold also criticized the drafts failure to include automatic exchange of information on beneficial ownership to tax authorities Automatic exchange of information is seen as more helpful in highlighting wrongdoing since offering information on a requested basis requires a tax authority to already have a suspicion of wrongdoing Editing by Mike Peacock

12/10/2012,Bank of England's Tucker to leave after losing out to Carney, LONDON  Reuters  Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker beaten to the central banks top job by Mark Carney will stand down later this year giving the Canadian an early chance to start reshaping the BoEs upper echelons   Tucker part of the majority of policymakers which opposes further bond buying had been expected to stand down ever since Carney the former head of Canadas central bank was named in November as the surprise choice for governor He will replace Mervyn King who retires from the BoE at the end of this month But the timing of the announcement took some by surprise  Tuckers term was due to end next February  and might be a sign that other top policymakers will bring forward their departures said Tom Vosa an economist at National Australia Bank The interesting bit will be whether the replacement is an internal or external candidate which will probably give you some clues as to how Carney expects to position the bank under his governorship Carney will head up a central bank that now has much greater powers and he is widely expected to start giving markets guidance on monetary policy soon after he takes over He has already decided to bring his former chief spokesman from the Bank of Canada with him in a possible sign he may pursue a more open communications style than King and that more external appointments are in the pipeline Tucker is likely to stay on at the BoE for the first months of Carneys term which starts on July 1 and the exact date of his departure will be confirmed in due course the BoE said in a statement When British finance minister George Osborne announced Carneys appointment in November he said he hoped Tucker would continue to work for the central bank But the disappointment of losing out on the governorship was widely seen as too bitter for Tucker who has been with the bank for more than 30 years Tucker who is responsible for financial stability had been seen as a strong candidate to succeed King But his chances took a knock in July last year when the BoE came under fire for failing to act on signs a few years earlier that banks had been rigging the LIBOR interbank interest rate Tucker was the BoEs executive director for markets at that point and was in close contact with Barclays  BARCL  chief executive Bob Diamond who later resigned over the scandal Tucker came under pressure over his apparently chummy relationship with Diamond Diamond said in an email after Tucker was promoted to deputy governor in December 2008 Congratulations Well done man I am really really proud of you Tucker replied Thanks so much Bob Youve been an absolute brick through this Alan Clarke an economist at Scotiabank said there was a risk that senior BoE staff were demotivated by the appointment of an outsider like Carney and that the bank should be prepared to promote its own staff I think they need to send a signal to bank insiders that there is room for internal promotion Youve got brilliant people at the Bank of England being lured away to investment banks he said Tucker plans to spend a period of time in academia in the United States the bank said in a statement The finance minister said in November that Charlie Bean a fellow BoE rate setter and another deputy governor would serve an extra year until mid2014 to help Carney settle in to his new role Additional reporting by Limei Hoang and  Christina Fincher  Editing by  Hugh Lawson 
12/07/2012,Wall St. Week Ahead: Investors will look to Fed to ease volatility, NEW YORK  Reuters  Stock investors eager to hear from the Federal Reserve about its plans for continuing economic stimulus may get some soothing words from the US central bank next week   The Fed is unlikely to tip its hand about when it may begin to scale back its bondbuying program but policymakers still may be inclined to try to tamp down recent volatility in financial markets with some mention of the issue The rally in stocks stumbled and Treasury bond yields rose to 14month highs following Chairman Ben Bernankes comments that the Fed may decide to begin scaling back its quantitative easing in the next few policy meetings if the economy improves As part of its quantitative easing policy adopted more than four years ago the Fed has been buying Treasury and other bonds each month to keep interest rates low and promote growth Interpreting Bernankes words and recent signs about the economy have roiled markets since then The Dow industrials climbed 200 points in eight of the 17 sessions since Bernankes comments and its daily average swing has been 1915 points What Bernanke has done is create what I call an early summer market storm not a huge one but enough to cause people to become a little nervous said Fred Dickson chief market strategist at DA Davidson  Co in Lake Oswego Oregon Stocks ended a third negative week in four The Dow fell 12 percent the SP 500 slid 1 percent and the Nasdaq lost 13 percent Next week might offer a bit more clarity he said but probably not the details many investors are hoping for Still analysts said the Fed may want to say something to remove some of the markets anxiety The markets have priced in a sea change and seem to think that rates are going up soon said Stephen Massocca managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco But I think the Fed is not going to want that to be the markets impression he said The news may be that any change is going to be gradual he added Comments from Fed policymakers in recent weeks have added fuel to the guessing game Views have ranged from favoring continuing the stimulus policies for some time to starting the process of winding down quantitative easing in the near term But Bernankes views hold the most weight so investors will likely be on edge awaiting his comments The Fed chairman is due to give a news conference at 230 pm on Wednesday shortly after the Feds policy committee ends a twoday meeting and issues a statement RALLY EASES Although earnings have taken a back seat to Fed talk forecasts for secondquarter profits have come down in recent weeks Growth is forecast at 32 percent down from an April 1 forecast of 61 percent and negative preannouncements have outnumbered positive ones by a ratio of 69 to 1 according to Thomson Reuters data That would be the most negative ratio since at least 1996 Investors worry speculation about the Feds course alone may have been enough to spark the longfeared pullback in stocks which have rallied for most of this year Even with recent losses the SP 500 is up 15 percent for the year to date The benchmark index is down 25 percent since May 21 but there have been shortlived rallies in that period Also the gains in bond yields since Bernankes comments caused investors to rotate out of highyielding dividend stocks Dividend stocks had been among the markets leaders as investors favored those shares over fixedincome securities in a low interestrate environment The Dow shot up 200 points and scored its best day since January 2 after the US employment report for May showed 175000 jobs were created a positive sign but not strong enough for the Fed to abandon stimulus efforts to aid the economy As we see mixed signals in terms of economic growth from across the globe a marginal tapering can have significant effects said Bucky Hellwig senior vice president at BBT Wealth Management in Birmingham Alabama What would happen if the tapering is too soon I think is that it puts risk into financial assets both equities and bonds Among next weeks economic reports the Consumer Price Report for May is due on Tuesday along with data on housing starts Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch Editing by Kenneth Barry

12/05/2012,Analysis: Bombardier gambles on big order payoff with new jet, TORONTO  Reuters  Canadas Bombardier Inc is hoping to carve a new niche in the cutthroat airplane market with a fuelefficient mediumhaul jet that makes its first flight this month but its allnew CSeries needs an avalanche of orders to stave off bigger rivals   Bombardiers narrowbody CSeries aimed at a gap in the market offers a lightweight carboncomposite frame like Boeing Cos 787 Dreamliner and new fuelsaving Pratt  Whitney engines But there are two big challenges Persuading the market theres room for a plane positioned midway between regional jets and bigger commercial planes and tempting customers to abandon the big players who have dominated for years Youre going up against some serious entrenched competition and if you have the balance sheet to get through that and gouge out a position in the market theres something here said Richard Aboulafia vice president of aviation consultancy Teal Group If you dont then youre jumping into a volcano with an armful of money Bombardier invested 34 billion to create the CSeries which has between 110 and 130 seats plus a tightly packed version that can seat up to 160 It expects 300 firm orders worth 19 billion by the time the plane enters service in mid2014 up from 177 at present Next weeks Paris Air Show offers a chance to boost the stillslim order book although the jet wont be on display Its maiden flight wont come until the end of June following a sixmonth delay that Bombardier blamed on supplier issues Bombardier insists its CSeries is now on schedule Im very comfortable with the first flight Im very comfortable with the entry into service said Mike Arcamone president of its commercial aircraft division Airbus and Boeing rule the world of bigger commercial jets and will defend their turf with discounts and revamped planes while Brazils Embraer SA the worlds No 3 planemaker leads in sales of smaller regional jets Embraer has 142 firm orders for its E195 with 110120 seats and 556 firm orders for the E190 with 100110 seats Boeing and Airbus have sold 3449 of their rival planes seating around 150 people although only a sliver of the sales are for smaller models that compete headon with the CSeries Its a sign either that Bombardier has found a promising niche or that the market simply wants differentsized planes IN DENIAL Montrealbased Bombardier says the CSeries can corner about half of the 6900 singleaisle 100 to 149seat jets that airlines are expected to buy over the next 20 years contributing 5 billion to 8 billion in annual revenue starting in 2018 Its a badly needed boost for Bombardier Plane sales were flat at 86 billion last year and train sales for the worlds biggest trainmaker fell 17 percent to 81 billion Bombardier is betting buyers will bite once the plane starts flying and especially once it enters service Chet Fuller sales chief of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft argues the whole industry has been bruised by delays that plagued planes like Boeings 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus 380 and has become more conservative But Airbus officials dismiss that They have long winters in Montreal They are obviously in denial Airbus sales chief John Leahy said of the Bombardier targets Also the performance claims were too optimistic he said The CSeries is the first allnew narrowbody plane in decades and Bombardier says it will cost less to buy and operate than rival jets Rather than compete with a new plane Boeing and Airbus have added new engines to existing aircraft to create their nextgeneration 737MAX and A320neo narrowbodied jets The CSeries plane is newer and lighter but the added efficiency from the new engines on Airbus and Boeing jets has so far convinced most airlines to stick with established suppliers The two big players are betting their upgraded models will hold the CSeries and other competitors at bay until around 2030 when they may bring out completely new designs They insist that the familiarity of existing jets will be a major selling point But experts say new engines wont be enough for the heavier Boeing and Airbus planes to match the longterm fuel efficiency and lower operating costs of new aircraft like the CSeries Analysts say discounts in the range of 50 percent from Boeing Airbus and Embraer will help At list prices the 110seat CS100 costs 63 million and the 130seat CS300 72 million The 126seat Boeing 737 MAX 7 costs 82 million and Airbuss 124seat A319neo 92 million Two finance sources who asked not to be named said the CSeries would have to sell for something closer to 35 to 40 million to win big orders WONT GIVE IT AWAY Bombardier Chief Executive Pierre Beaudoin says he will not give away the CSeries and the company has rejected deep discounts and other sweeteners If Bombardier gets a firm footing with the current CSeries it could stretch the plane to add more seats and has trademarked the names CS500 and CS900 just in case Bombardier hopes the plane can reignite its stock which is languishing at 2002 levels and a fraction of its 2000 peak of C2670 The stock was up 7 cents to C474 on Thursday Clearly the CSeries is quite pivotal in terms of the shortterm price reaction of the stock said Greg Kocik managing director of TD Asset Management a top10 shareholder that owned 1125 million Bombardier shares at April 30 according to Thomson Reuters data And definitely the longterm success of the company hinges on good execution of the CSeries program but its not like theyre betting the farm on this one program Theyre a diversified

11/28/2012,Detroit defaults on some debt to avoid bankruptcy filing, DETROIT  Reuters  Detroit said on Friday it would stop making payments on some of its about 185 billion debt which would put it in default and the insolvent city called on most of its creditors to accept pennies on the dollar to help it avoid the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history   In a forceful opening salvo of negotiations with debt holders Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr announced a moratorium on some principal and interest payments including one payment he said was due on Friday Under his proposal Orr said unsecured debt holders would be paid less than 10 cents on the dollar but some creditors would get a bit more based on city revenue Some 115 billion of the debt is unsecured and 7 billion secured according to figures presented by Orr Orr said secured creditors would get better treatment although how much better was not specified We may try to get a discount from them but the reality is they are secured Orr said Secured credit means an asset is pledged to back the debt For example Detroit has secured its interest rate swap agreements with casino revenue He said the city would skip a 34 million payment due on Friday on 143 billion of pension certificates of participation to allow the city to conserve cash needed to provide services to residents Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poors Ratings Services immediately downgraded Detroits rating to a level reserved for borrowers about to default We expect default to be a virtual certainty SP said in a statement accompanying its downgrade to CC from CCCnegative A trustee for the bond issue will have to certify that Detroit failed to make the payment on Friday which would trigger a formal default Detroits crisis is being closely watched by US debt markets It did not immediately affect the 37 trillion US municipal bond market where prices ended higher on Friday Orr said he would meet with creditors over the next 30 days Market participants said the outcome of those talks could lead to higher interest rates for the state of Michigan and even the broader market if Orr wins concessions from secured creditors Financial mismanagement a shrinking population a dwindling tax base and other factors over the past 45 years have brought Detroit to the brink of financial and operational ruin Orr said in a statement Orr said the city was insolvent unable to pay its debts and needed shared sacrifices from everyone including debt holders to have any hope of a revival Insolvency and inability to pay debts are two tests a government must meet for a judge to accept a Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy It looks and feels like a prepackaged bankruptcy plan said Richard Ciccarone managing director at McDonnell Investment Management in reaction to the proposal A prepackaged bankruptcy is when an entity negotiates a deal with creditors and other interested parties in advance and presents that to a bankruptcy court judge Orr a bankruptcy attorney brought in by the state of Michigan to clean up the citys finances repeated after the meeting that he sees a 5050 chance of a bankruptcy filing It would be a first for a major US city as New York Philadelphia and Cleveland all avoided formal bankruptcy filings during their financial difficulties New York also declared a moratorium on some debt payments in the 1970s but creditors were ultimately paid in full under a restructuring agreement said Jim Spiotto a municipal bankruptcy expert at law firm Chapman and Cutler in Chicago In addition to the financial details the 134page document presented on Friday describes collapsing city services rising crime and falling tax receipts Detroit is the poorest large city in the United States with more than a third of its residents living below the official government poverty line while its population has shrunk to about 700000 people The city has the highest violent crime rate of any major US city some 78000 abandoned and blighted structures and 40 percent of street lights dark the document said Only about a third of the citys ambulances were in service in the first quarter of 2013 Just 53 percent of owners paid their 2011 property taxes The document disclosed that Detroit could face unfunded pension liabilities such as for retired police and fire workers of 35 billion up from the 644 million previously estimated Orr said unsecured creditors including bondholders and pension funds will receive a pro rata share of 2 billion of notes the city would issue and pay off as its financial circumstances improve An oversight board could be created for Detroit similar to one set up after New York Citys financial difficulties in 1970s that would ensure reforms are sustained Orr said The New York board created in 1975 still exists although it is largely symbolic City workers and retirees would also face changes to their pensions and health care coverage consistent with available funding At the same time Orr proposed investing 125 billion over the next 10 years to improve the citys infrastructure remove or repair crumbling houses and update computer systems Initial reaction from debt holders and labor unions was negative Emerging from the meeting one bond holder who asked not to be identified said of Orrs proposal to pay them only pennies on the dollar Its just too much It is an unprecedented amount to ask In the past bondholders have not lost the principal amount owed them as a result of the financial restructuring of major cities such as New York and Cleveland Much of Detroits debt is insured giving bondholders protection against defaults Two of the insurers National Public Finance Guarantee Corp a unit of MBIA and Assured Guaranty Ltd confirmed they attended the meeting In the event that debt service payments by the City of Detroit are interrupted National will ensure that its policyholders receive all of their principal and interest payments on time and in full spokesman Kevin Brown said Leaders of some of Detroits 48 public sector unions were upset by Orrs proposals which included spinning off water and sewer services into an independent authority as well as making the changes to pensions and health care coverage When youre backed into a corner the only thing you can do is fight and the only way we can fight is to strike said Mike Mulholland secretary and treasurer of AFSCME Local 207 the union that represents water and sewer workers Additional reporting by  Karen Pierog   Deepa Seetharaman  Joseph Lichterman  Tiziana Barghini  Tom Hals and Alison

11/23/2012,EU insurance watchdog unveils benchmark capital rules, FRANKFURT  Reuters  The European Unions insurance watchdog on Friday unveiled its proposals for rules to regulate longterm savings guarantees that are popular with life insurance policy holders   Insurance products with guaranteed returns are big business particularly in Germany and the Netherlands but insurers have said earlier drafts by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority EIOPA were flawed and needed rewriting On Friday EIOPA unveiled the results of a study carried out with insurers earlier this year which will be used by the European Commission in finalizing the text for a new risk capital regime for the insurance sector known as Solvency II expected to take effect in 2016 EIOPA Chairman Gabriel Bernardino said the watchdogs report should lay the foundation for an informed political decision on how to handle longterm guarantees under the Solvency II rules Solvency II is a sound framework that needs to be implemented as soon as possible Bernardino said in a statement Experience will help us to further improve the regime once it is already in place That strategy might not sit well with the industry said Charles Garnsworth a partner at auditing firm PwC Many insurers may find the proposals onerous and will not welcome the continued uncertainty over the final rules Garnsworth said in a statement SEEKING COMPROMISE Large parts of Solvency II have been agreed but regulators who have been honing the rules for more than a decade ran into an impasse over how to measure future obligations to policy holders and the capital insurers must set aside to meet those obligations when longterm guarantees are involved Insurers worried that the rules could create artificial volatility in their balance sheets in the face of shortterm fluctuations in the value of assets they hold which are mainly highquality bonds To avoid that volatility insurers said they might have to cut back on investments that could otherwise support growth in the wider economy Europes insurers have about 85 trillion euros 1134 trillion in assets under management EIOPA came forward on Friday with various proposals to deal with the longterm guarantees including a socalled volatility balancer that it said would be a predictable and permanent way around the volatility problem It also proposed what it called a classical matching adjustment in the formula for calculating the value of future liabilities for annuities products a move that was welcomed by Julian Adams Executive Director of Insurance at the Bank of England We are pleased that the classic matching adjustment is now recognized as a prudent approach Adams said in a statement Late on Friday analysts were still poring over the details of EIOPAs proposals German insurance association GDV said it was too early to give an immediate comment on Friday 1  07496 euros Reporting by  Jonathan Gould  and Alexander Huebner editing by  Tom Pfeiffer

11/20/2012,Analysis: U.S. plastics from gas threaten European petchem industry, FRANKFURT  Reuters  The oildependent European petrochemicals industry could be in for a body blow as US rivals seek to get a wider range of raw materials out of cheap shale gas to make more plastics coatings and adhesives   US players including Dow Chemical  DOWN  and Enterprise Products Partners  EPDN  are building facilities to convert gas into propylene a key building block for advanced materials that has so far required the oil distillate naphtha as feedstock This could further squeeze margins and endanger jobs at European plants that convert naphtha into precursor chemicals ethylene and propylene the backbone of the more than 130 billion euro 167 billion petrochemical industry in Europe The European facilities run by global players including BASF  BASFnDE  Sabic 2010SE Ineos INEOSGUL and LyondellBasell  LYBN  are particularly vulnerable to any price decline in propylene which goes into acrylic glass insulation foam and construction glues as extra US output has already slashed the price of ethylene Fortyeight of these sites called steam crackers are spread across Europe mainly in Benelux Germany and France The companies that run them can shift investment elsewhere but jobs will be at risk in Europe the industry employs 115000 directly and up to 460000 indirectly in a region that hit a record 11 percent unemployment in April According to a Bernstein Research note last month BASF is eyeing a 600 million investment in a new US gastopropylene plant The company declined to comment Shale gas  natural gas from hydraulic fracturing or fracking  has allowed the US chemical industry to use cheap energy and boost output of ethylene a basic hydrocarbon precursor for solvents packaging plastics and detergents that can be extracted from gas The benefits were evident in LyondellBasells Olefins and Polyolefins business which boasted an operating profit margin of 20 percent in the Americas last year compared with 09 percent in Europe and the rest of the world The Atlantic divide could widen further as they ramp up propylene output and while health and environmental concerns stifle shale gas exploration in Europe Companies like Dow Enterprise Products and Taiwans Formosa Plastics  1301TW  aim to produce extra propylene volumes on the Texas Gulf Coast from 2015 European crackers average revenue per tonne after deduction of feedstock and energy costs has been 659 this year versus 798 in the United States according to market researcher ICIS ONPURPOSE PROPYLENE Propylene had become scarce and expensive as the prevailing method of converting gas into basic petrochemicals  natural gas steam cracking  yields abundant ethylene but little propylene Steam crackers that feed on the oil distillate naphtha the cracker type that prevails in Europe are the main source of propylene but only as a byproduct More than half their output is ethylene now made far more cheaply in the United States where natural gas prices have plunged 50 percent in five years Only a price hike in byproducts such as propylene and butadiene used in synthetic rubber and nylon has provided some relief for the European basic petrochemicals industry Operators of European naphtha crackers have a problem In a nutshell its about propylene butadiene and benzene prices You need to be compensated somewhere for the cheaper ethylene said Londonbased Berenberg Bank analyst Jaideep Pandya But now propylene is set to become cheaper US oil and petrochemical groups are erecting socalled onpurpose propylene production sites based on propane from natural gas to end reliance on the insufficient stream of byproduct propylene from ethylene production New onpurpose plants could add roughly 4 million tonnes to annual propylene output by 2018 5 percent of current global production says market researcher IHS Chemical BASF said many of the industrys European sites would remain competitive due to an intricate network of pipelines and proximity to customers while imports from the Middle East and the US were burdened with tariffs and transport costs Ineos plans to ship cheap US ethane gas to its gas cracker in Norway from 2015 to secure the long term future of its sites in Europe But its naphtha crackers cant use ethane The regions downstream specialty chemical makers which use propylene as raw material may also be in for a shakeup The nascent US gastopropylene industry is widely expected to further process its source of cheap feedstock into intermediates such as propylene oxide acrylic acid and polypropylene in about three to five years This could become a headache for the European advanced plastics industry Propylene oxides go into insulation foam chemicals made by BASF and Bayer  BAYGnDE  while acrylic acid is the basis for adhesives acrylic glass and glossy coatings offered by BASF Evonik  EVKnDE  and Arkema  AKEPA  The quickest gains for US propylene makers would be to expand into polypropylene a standard plastic used in packaging sticky tape and ropes which plays only a minor role in European production but they wouldnt stop there Chuck Carr a Houstonbased petrochemicals adviser at IHS said the first 3 million tonnes of new annual US propylene would address the domestic shortage but everything beyond could go oversees in the form of specialty chemicals and plastics Were going to add enough to export he said Editing by Will Waterman
11/19/2012,Employment experts predict wave of lawsuits from unpaid interns, NEW YORK  Reuters  When two former interns at the New Yorker and W Magazine sued parent company Conde Nast Publications on Thursday legal experts said it could be the first in a wave of lawsuits challenging companies who pay little or nothing for student labor   The lawsuit comes just two days after a judge found that Fox Searchlight Pictures violated labor laws when it used unpaid interns for production tasks on Black Swan the 2010 film starring Natalie Portman Employment lawyers said that decision and similar lawsuits that are likely to follow would force employers to reconsider using unpaid or underpaid interns first in glamour industries such as movies and publishing where the practice has become standard and then in industries that have implemented similar policies to reduce labor costs in a flagging economy This trend is probably going to expand beyond media companies and beyond New York said Laura ODonnell a lawyer at Haynes  Boone in San Antonio who represents management in labor disputes I think employers in all industries across the country need to take note Thursdays lawsuit was filed in US District Court for the Southern District of New York which also had issued the decision on Tuesday against News Corps  NWSAO  Fox Searchlight Lauren Ballinger an intern at W Magazine for several months in 2009 and Matthew Leib who had internships at the New Yorker in 2009 and 2010 said Conde Nast violated federal labor laws Ballinger received 12 a day to organize accessories run personal errands for editors and make deliveries to vendors Leib got a flat rate of 300 to 500 for each three to fourmonth internship which included reviewing submissions to the New Yorkers Shouts and Murmurs section responding to emails sent to the magazine proofreading and opening mail The lawsuit which seeks a class action on behalf of all affected Conde Nast workers said the Fair Labor Standards Act required the company to pay an hourly minimum wage Law firm Outten  Golden which brought both the Conde Nast and the Fox Searchlight lawsuits is identifying individuals who held unpaid internships during the past six years and is reviewing the conditions of their employment for possible wageandhour violations The firm is also handling a lawsuit against Hearst Corp by former Harpers Bazaar magazine intern Xuedan Wang In that case Judge Harold Baer also in the Southern District of New York said Wang who had sought classaction certification could not sue on behalf of other interns The law firm is appealing the ruling and Wang can still bring suit as an individual PBS talk show host Charlie Rose agreed to settle a similar class action brought by Outten  Golden late last year on behalf of 190 unpaid interns who worked on his eponymous program between March 2006 and October 2012 BENEFIT TEST These young people are conscious of economic and class issues Juno Turner a lawyer at Outten  Golden said of the Conde Nast lawsuit They see that people who are able to do these internships are people of means whose families are able to support them while they work for little or no pay Theyre standing up and saying Ive had enough of this A Conde Nast representative said the company did not comment on pending litigation The US Labor Department has developed a sixpronged test based on a decadesold Supreme Court case related to railroad company trainees to determine whether interns at forprofit companies must be paid It takes into account factors that include the educational value of the experience and whether interns displace regular workers The real key to the test is that the internship has to be for the benefit of the intern as opposed to the employer ODonnell said Although unpaid internships are difficult to track their prevalence is apparent in an annual survey of more than 30000 students conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers NACE For the past three years nearly half of all interns surveyed have reported working without pay The 2013 Student Survey found that while paid internships increased the likelihood of receiving a permanent job offer unpaid interns fared only slightly better than students who did no internship at all The median starting salary for a newly minted graduate with paid internship experience is 51930 but only 35721 for those who have completed an unpaid internship the survey said That pattern was consistent across all academic majors NACE researcher Edwin Koc said Ross Eisenbrey of the Economic Policy Institute a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington said wouldbe interns should think twice about agreeing to work without pay even to get a foot in the door You signal to employers that you arent worth that much if youre willing to work for nothing Eisenbrey said The case is Lauren Ballinger and Matthew Leib v Advance Magazine Publishers Inc dba Conde Nast Publications US District Court for the Southern

11/16/2012,Air rivalry intensifies as Airbus A350 makes first flight, TOULOUSE France  Reuters  After the Dreamliner the Hushliner   Europes latest passenger jet the Airbus A350 made its maiden flight on Friday and its chief salesman opening a new front in a battle with US rival Boeing Co  BAN  declared it so quiet that airport residents wont even notice it The lightweight carbonplastic jet flew over the Airbus plant in Toulouse to salute production workers before wrapping up a fourhour inaugural flight that Airbus officials said had achieved more than expected Watched by 10000 staff and spectators the aircrafts curled wingtips sliced into clouds above the factory in southwestern France and flew over the Pyrenees The sortie caps eight years of designing and development costing an estimated 15 billion Airbuss ebullient New Yorkborn sales chief John Leahy lost no time in talking up the planes benefits moments after its two RollRoyce  RRL  engines hoisted the A350 from the same runway where the supersonic Concorde took its first groundshaking run 44 years ago Did you hear how quiet it was We are going to set new standards  People round airports wont even know we are taking off Leahy said It is a milestone for the EADS  EADPA  unit as it seeks to catch Boeings 787 Dreamliner in sales of a generation of lightweight jets designed to save fuel and do less harm to the environment Boeing was first off the mark with the use of revolutionary carboncomposite materials and its Dreamliner has so far outsold the A350 with sales reaching 833 aircraft to 57 customers With sales of 613 planes to 33 customers Airbus hopes to catch up and also mount a challenge to the US manufacturers larger metallic 777 thanks in part to the A350s low noise READY TO FLY British test pilot Peter Chandler who commanded a crew of six pilots and test engineers wearing helmets and parachutes over orange jumpsuits was elated about the plane It was ready to fly and it wanted to fly It was clearly much happier in the air Chandler said French copilot Guy Magrin a former air force pilot took the controls for the takeoff at 1001 local time 4 am ET Competition for widebodied jets is expected to dominate next weeks Paris Airshow where the A350 has its sights on another flyby when French President Francois Hollande visits the event on Friday if tests continue to go well I am talking to airlines about placing orders in the very new future I think you may see some announcements very soon sales chief Leahy told Reuters Airbus is finalizing orders from Singapore Airlines  SIALSI   Kuwait Airways and Air France  AIRFPA  and hopes to add a new customer at the June 1723 show analysts say Boeing sees a market worth 1 trillion for one category of midsized longhaul passenger airplanes over the next 20 years and the A350 and 787 are chasing the lions share of that More expensive than other aircraft at about 300 million apiece at list prices the A350s business case relies on fuel savings of some 25 percent compared with ordinary airliners But aerospace manufacturers are also under pressure to cut emissions and noise to comply with tougher global regulations EDGE ON NOISE Airbus and Boeing both claim the edge on noise levels which remain politically explosive at airports like Londons Heathrow Airbus said the A350 is up to 16 decibels below international requirements Boeing said its 787 has a smaller noise footprint than other widebody aircraft and is equivalent to the sounds of heavy traffic when standing at a roadside We welcome any moves towards quieter planes but lets not run away with the idea that the A350 is a quiet plane It is simply less noisy than its predecessors said John Stewart chair of a residents group opposing the expansion of Heathrow The A350s maiden flight is the start of a 12 to 13 month test program that will include putting it through the harshest possible conditions around the globe Airbus says it is on track to put the aircraft into service with Qatar Airways in the second half of 2014 but the timetable remains challenging Project leader Didier Evrard a former missiles boss credited with preventing a repeat of the disarray on recent Airbus programs has a major job to produce four more test aircraft and could not relax during the flight I will still be nervous until it comes back Im an engineer so I have to be connected to the ground and make sure everything is fine he told reporters Evrard said Airbus would soon add a customer in the United States where industry sources say United Airlines is negotiating to expand an order for 25 jets Airbus initially dismissed new midsized aircraft like the 787 as it focused on building the worlds largest airliner the A380 superjumbo in the last decade But faced with burgeoning Dreamliner sales it changed tack and overhauled the design of the 270 to 350seat A350 by adopting similar composites technology in 2006 To boost sales Boeing is expected to soon confirm plans to build a larger version of its Dreamliner It is also overhauling its 777 with new engines and wings Additional reporting by  Rhys Jones  Editing by Paul Taylor and  David Holmes

11/09/2012,Exclusive: Deutsche Bank 'horribly undercapitalized' - U.S. regulator, WASHINGTON  Reuters  A top US banking regulator called Deutsche Banks capital levels horrible and said it is the worst on a list of global banks based on one measurement of leverage ratios   Its horrible I mean theyre horribly undercapitalized said Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig in an interview They have no margin of error Hoenig who is secondincommand at the regulator said global capital rules known as the Basel III accord allow lenders to appear wellcapitalized when they are not That is because the rules allow the banks to use complicated measurements of how risky their loans are to determine the capital they must hold he said But using a tougher leverage ratio measurement  which compares a banks shareholder equity to its total assets without using riskweightings  the picture for banks such as Deutsche Bank is very different he said Deutsche Bank this year is almost done raising 5 billion euros 667 billion in new debt and equity boosting its core capital ratio to around 95 percent which it says has made it one of the bestcapitalized banks among its peers To say that we are undercapitalized is inaccurate because if you look at the Basel framework were now one of the best capitalized banks in the world after our capital raise Deutsche Banks Chief Financial Officer Stefan Krause told Reuters in an interview when asked about Hoenigs comments To suggest that leverage puts us in a position to be a risk to the system is incorrect Krause said calling the gauge a misleading measure when used on its own Deutsches leverage ratio stood at 163 percent according to Hoenigs numbers which are based on European IFRS accounting rules as of the end of 2012 Deutsche said the number now stands at 21 percent but that it does not look at the gauge Using US generally accepted accounting principles the ratio stood at a much more comfortable 45 percent Krause said OUTSPOKEN CRITIC The difference is due to the way derivatives on a banks books are measured Neither number directly corresponds to the Basel leverage ratio which calculates capital in another way and sets a 3 percent minimum The FDIC  which guarantees deposits at US banks  stressed that Hoenig was speaking in a personal capacity and that the agency did not comment on individual banks Hoenig staked out a reputation as a dissenting voice against the Federal Reserves loose monetary policy in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis when he was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Hes also an outspoken critic of the Basel III rules  introduced globally after the crisis  which he says do not do enough to reduce the size of the riskiest banks and are easy for them to game Other banks with a low ratio according to Hoenig are UBS at 252 percent Morgan Stanley at 255 percent Credit Agricole at 272 percent and Societe Generale at 284 percent Detailed rules for Basel III which other US politicians and regulators have questioned are expected to come out in the United States in the next few months well past the January deadline agreed upon internationally DESCRIBES RIDICULOUS CHANGE Hoenig pointed to the gain in Deutsche Bank shares in January on the same day it posted a big quarterly loss because it had improved its Basel III capital ratios by cutting riskweighted assets My other example with poor Deutsche Bank is that they lose 2 billion and raise their capital ratio Its  I dont want to say insane but its ridiculous Hoenig said A leverage ratio is a better method to show a firms ability to absorb sudden losses Hoenig says and he has floated a plan to raise the ratio to 10 percent He said the 3 percent leverage hurdle under Basel was a pretend number Opponents of using such a ratio say that it ignores the risk in a banks loan books and can make a bank with only healthy borrowers look equally risky as a bank whose clients are less likely to pay back their loans It also fails to take into account how easily a bank can sell its assets  socalled liquidity  or whether it is hedged against risk Still equity analysts said that while Deutsche Bank likely will meet regulatory capital requirements its ratios look weak The capital raise was warmly received by the market Berenberg Bank said in a note this week However we still remain concerned about the leverage in the business To get above the 3 percent level mandated by Basel required by 2019 requires four years worth of profits and in our view delays dividends 1  07496 euros Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Douwe Miedema Editing by Karey Van Hall  Martin Howell  and  Leslie Gevirtz 
11/08/2012,IMF urges repeal of 'ill-designed' U.S. cuts, WASHINGTON  Reuters  The International Monetary Fund urged the United States on Friday to repeal sweeping government spending cuts and recommended that the Federal Reserve continue a bondbuying program through at least the end of the year   In its annual check of the health of the US economy the IMF forecast economic growth would be a sluggish 19 percent this year The IMF estimates growth would be as much as 175 percentage points higher if not for a rush to cut the governments budget deficit The IMF cut its outlook for economic growth in 2014 to 27 percent below its 3 percent forecast published in April The Fund said in April it still assumed the deep government spending cuts would be repealed but it had now dropped that assumption Washington slashed the federal budget in March adding to the drag on the economy created by tax increases enacted in January The IMF said the United States should reverse the spending cuts and instead adopt a plan to slow the growth in spending on governmentfunded health care and pensions known as entitlements The Fund would also like the United States to collect more in taxes The deficit reduction in 2013 has been excessively rapid and illdesigned the IMF said These cuts should be replaced with a backloaded mix of entitlement savings and new revenues The IMF warned cuts to education science and infrastructure spending could reduce potential growth While the Fund said total debt across all levels of government would likely decline after 2015 public finances are nevertheless on an unsustainable path due to an aging population and higher spending on health care Now our advice is not just to slow down budget cuts IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said at a news conference Our advice is also to hurry up hurry up with putting in place a mediumterm road map to restore longrun fiscal sustainability She said effects of higher spending on health care and other programs build up over time so it was important to act quickly to address them KEEP EASING FOR NOW The Fund recommended that the US Federal Reserve keep up its massive asset purchases at least through the end of the year to support the US recovery but should also prepare for a pullback in the future The Fed is currently buying 85 billion per month of Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities in an effort to lower borrowing costs and spur employment growth Lagarde said the IMF has assumed that the Fed would begin trimming bond purchases next year Speculation over when the Fed might start to pare back its bond buying has roiled financial markets recently Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stoked market speculation last month when he said a decision to pare the Feds current pace of asset purchases might happen at one of the Feds next few meetings if the economy looked set to maintain momentum Recent outflows from bond funds and the rise in volatility offer a worrying glimpse of how markets are likely to behave as the Fed works to scale back its enormous monetary stimulus The IMF said unwinding the easymoney policies would likely present challenges and it was key for the Fed to communicate effectively with markets It also said the long period of low interest rates could have unintended consequences in the future sowing the seeds of future financial vulnerabilities Additional reporting by  Jason Lange  Editing by  Andrea Ricci  and  Andre Grenon

05/21/2012,Petroplus shuts 3 oil refineries as cash runs out, PARISNEUCHATEL Switzerland Reuters    Petroplus PPHNS is to close three of its five oil refineries over the coming weeks because it has run out of money for crude supplies since bankers froze its credit lines abruptly this week Talks with the bankers have been open and constructive and will continue in the coming days the financially troubled company said in a statement about the closures on Friday In the meantime the company will start temporary economic shutdowns of the Petit Couronne France Antwerp Belgium and Cressier Switzerland refineries in January 2012 given limited credit availability and the economic climate in Europe A victim of oversupply in European refining and of an investment strategy under former boss Thomas OMalley that fell foul of an industry downturn Petroplus and European government officials have been locked in talks with the 13 banks that froze a 1 billion facility it needed to buy crude oil Fridays announcement follows days of talks among bankers government officials and the company aimed at keeping fuel flowing from Europes biggest independent refiner A source close to the situation said a provisional financing agreement had been found to keep the talks going after intensive talks involving banks the company and local governments And a Swiss local government official said he was urging the banking consortium to reconsider although he did not confirm any breakthrough I called yesterday to both Swiss banks UBS  UBSNVX  and Credit Suisse  CSGNVX  to insist on the local and strategic importance of the Cressier plant said Thierry Grosjean Economy Minister at the Swiss canton of Neuchatel home to Petropluss Cressier refinery Traders and analysts expect a large customer supplier or banker could step in to keep plants running at some point But despite efforts so far workers at the companys French and Belgian refineries were already preparing shutdowns on Sunday and Monday according to officials and trade unions There is no more crude coming in so the plant cannot work any more so we need to start shutting down all the plants units on Monday but this is a technical shutdown said a spokeswoman for Petroplus in France The shutdown will take about a week The Cressier plant has enough crude to last between 15 and 20 days according to the head of economic services in the canton of Neuchatel Patrick Cossettini Traders said that of Petropluss five plants the UK plant in Coryton might be the last to stop given its superior tank holding capacity WHY FREEZE NOW It remained unclear why the banks cut funding so abruptly just two months after allowing the troubled company to breach debt covenants without penalty Analysts and traders believe a worsening outlook for the industry and pressure from governments on banks to boost bank capital might be among the reasons for the unusual move but one loan industry player thought otherwise For me this is a clear signal that something must have happened  banks dont do that Banks would only act in such a manner if something has occurred This is very untypical  some information is clearly missing said a head of loan syndicate who is not involved in Petroplus financing but still did not want to be named Apart from Fridays statement Swissbased Petroplus has not responded to phone calls and emails from Reuters and has declined to elaborate on a December 27 announcement on the frozen credit lines OMALLEY CONNECTION The ailing companys latest financing problems throw a spotlight on Thomas OMalley the veteran oil refining entrepreneur who took over at the head of the company in 2006 but who in 2011 stepped down as chairman and reduced his personal stake in the business below 3 percent He remains CEO and chairman at PBF Energy a joint venture of private equity firms Blackstone and First Reserve In November PBF announced plans to raise funds through an initial public offering Petroplus refineries are at Cressier in Switzerland Petit Couronne in France Coryton in the United Kingdom Antwerp in Belgium and Ingolstadt in Germany Together they account for about 44 percent of European Union capacity But given the amount of slack in the industry the closures are not expected to create a major supply issue but governments particularly in France where elections are coming up next year are anxious to avoid closure The European refining sector has been struggling for years due to poor margins and weak demand for fuel products French major Total  TOTFPA  shut its Dunkirk refinery at the start of 2010 and Petroplus itself closed down its Reichstett plant in eastern France in May 2011 Petropluss 13 lenders which include BNP Paribas BNPPA Societe Generale  SOGNPA  Natixis  CNATPA  Credit Suisse  CSGNVX  Morgan Stanley  MSN  and Deutsche Bank  DBKGnDE  continued to negotiate on Friday The companys stock price has halved since Tuesdays announcement of the freeze but had gained 85 percent to 178 euros 1400 GMT on Friday amid hopes the provisional financing agreement might mean a positive solution may be found Reporting By Marie Maitre Additional reporting by Lionel Laurent in

05/18/2012,You thought 2011 was tough?, NEW YORK  Reuters  Shaky Europe Political gridlock Volatile markets   Familiar themes for those who lived through 2011 and investors should be ready to revisit them next year With a spiraling debt crisis in Europe political upheaval around the world and crumbling creditworthiness in major industrial nations 2011 was a tough year to know where to invest 2012 is unlikely to offer much respite The SP 500 a measure of the biggest US companies market value spent much of the year getting pushed up and down flummoxing shorts and longs  and scaring Moms and Pops away from stocks It ended the year at 125760 down a mere 004 of a point But the SP 500s tepid performance was encouraging compared with other world equity markets The United States may still be seen as a safe haven though even that looks uncertain For every rally built on improving economic figures this year selloffs were never far away on worries the European debt crisis would eventually drag the continent into a recession and perhaps the United States as well That could continue in 2012 China and other fastgrowing emerging markets can no longer be leaned on as those economies slow In 2011s last half the poorestperforming sectors outside of banks were most connected to global growth  materials energy and industrial companies There is a growing realization that the global economy is in jeopardy said Bruce Bittles chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird  Co in Nashville There is uncertainty in every corner of the world That uncertainty fed substantial volatility in 2011 Despite the SPs flat performance this year there were 66 trading days when stocks moved in a 2 percent range In 2008 when Lehman Brothers collapsed during a global financial crisis there were more than 130 trading days when stocks swung that much But that led to a flight from equities by retail investors US equity funds had outflows in every month since May More than 483 billion left US mutual funds in 2011 through the years secondtolast week even though the US market outperformed foreign stocks late in the game BEATING GLOBAL RIVALS The SP 500 ended the year off a scant 0003 percent the closest it has come to unchanged since 1947 according to Standard  Poors The Dow Jones industrial average  DJI  finished 2011 with a 55 percent gain while the Nasdaq Composite Index  IXIC  slipped 18 percent In contrast the MSCI world stocks index MIWD00000PUS fell 9 percent while the FTSEurofirst300 index  FTEU3  slid nearly 11 percent The darlings in the emerging markets fared the worst Chinas Shanghai Composite index  SSEC  lost 22 percent Indias BSE  BSESN  sank 25 percent and Brazils Bovespa  BVSP  dropped 18 percent Strategists say the US stock market may benefit from reasonable economic growth and attractive market valuation The SP 500 is expected to rise 6 percent by the end of 2012 according to the most recent poll of Wall Street strategists EPOLLUS When Wall Street gets back to work on Tuesday it will face a holidayshortened week and a slew of economic indicators The most crucial numbers will come on Friday when the government will release the December nonfarm payrolls report Economists polled by Reuters expect a December gain of 150000 jobs compared with an increase of 120000 jobs in November Volatility is likely to persist through early 2012 because of the uncertainty in Europe and rising concern about slowed earnings growth due to recent revisions The SP 500s pricetoearnings ratio  what investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings  is under 12 below the 25year average of 15 In weaker markets like Germanys DAX the figure is below 9 Were building in a massive recession into these numbers said Marc Pado US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald  Co in San Francisco US companies cutting earnings outlooks recently outpaced those raising theirs by the greatest ratio in 10 years Some sectors such as materials have seen a sharp drop in forecasts for the fourth quarter Thomson Reuters data showed Last week downbeat earnings from Oracle Corp ORCLO shook confidence in the tech sectors health before the quarterly earnings seasons start in January Oracle joined a growing list of companies including some of technologys biggest names whose results and outlooks have set off alarm bells Next year SP 500 earnings are seen rising 99 percent down from an estimate of 13 percent in October  Graphics Global markets in 2011 Volatile and Unpredictable  rreuterscomxut75s  RECESSION FEARS Many economists believe the euro zone is already in recession They forecast that the economies of the 17nation bloc will stagnate in 2012 after contracting in this years fourth quarter and the first quarter of the next Investors are worried that Italy and Spain will have to keep refinancing borrowings at unsustainable levels early next year which could escalate the crisis The correlation between the US stock market and the euro skyrocketed in 2011 as investors tied bets on risky assets to the euros moves That trend ebbed as equities rallied near the end of the year but it is likely to flare up again So far the US economy has stayed on course for moderate growth Economists expect it to expand by about 21 percent next year But it is unclear how a slowdown in the rest of the world will affect the economy stateside The key may be China rather than Europe China is the 800pound gorilla in the room and is probably the most important country to watch in terms of their contribution to global growth said Michael Sheldon chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport Connecticut Chinese business confidence is weakening A survey showed export orders fell for the first time in nearly three years The drop in materials shares in 2011s second half reflects worry about declining activity overseas The SP Materials Index GSPM lost nearly 14 percent in the last six months GRIDLOCK SHOCK One of the pivotal events of 2011 was the downgrade of the United States perfect tripleA credit rating Standard  Poors cited congressional bickering as the reason for the downgrade Augusts stalemate in Washington over raising the debt ceiling sparked a selloff that accelerated after the downgrade Investors expect the gridlock in Congress to get worse as the US presidential election approaches in November The election is likely to be close which will not make legislative efforts to tackle high debt levels and weak demand any easier Rancor was in view again in December as Congress struggled to pass a twomonth extension of US payrolltax cuts There will be less certainty about taxation and regulation so that will inhibit business formation and business growth said Brian Battle a trader at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago Goldman Sachs sees global growth highly susceptible in 2012 to even minor shocks  and those shocks may be political Slowing growth and in places outright contraction publicsector cuts and a

05/15/2012,Dawn of a year of trading dangerously, LONDON  Reuters  Out with the old year in with the new and for investors uncertainty is likely to be the only certainty once more   The euro zone debt crisis is far from resolved turmoil in the Arab world has shifted to Syria and Iran has threatened to stop the flow of oil from the Gulf if sanctions are imposed due to its nuclear ambitions 2011 was a dire year for equities outside the United States with world stocks poised to drop by around eight percent and emerging markets faring far worse Crude oil has been among the best performers with a roughly 10 percent increase and gold has matched it as a loss of confidence in the euro zone accelerated a flight to bullion So where next The answer to that question depends on whether you believe policymakers in Europe Asia and America will muddle through or whether a new cataclysm is imminent While the global economy remains shaky central banks will maintain ultralow interest rates a potential fillip for stocks as bond yields languish in countries viewed as safe havens Globally inflation should subside though the path of oil prices is hard to discern given the tumult in the Middle East and Gulf Signs of a modest US revival and Chinas ability to gently massage down economic growth in order to prevent inflation taking off will be key for the markets but the euro zone remains the great imponderable Italy alone faces frightening debt refinancing hurdles in the first four months of the year Having proved remarkably resilient all year the euro is ending the year on a downslope breaking below key support levels to its lowest point in 2011 An Italian bond auction on Thursday saw yields edge down but only slightly Given the scale of its funding requirements there are still big concerns about Italys ability to get through 2012 said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy Next quarter is going to be all about Italy Next week sees the release of purchasing managers indices for January and December inflation figures a first new year gauge of the euro zones economic malaise In terms of debt supply France and Germany but not Italy come to the market While there are plenty of pessimists predicting the euro zone cannot survive in its current form after its leaders failed to construct a bazooka big enough to scare the markets off others believe there is potentially enough in train to take the sting out of a debt crisis now well into its third year The combination of the European Central Banks provision of unlimited threeyear liquidity for banks steps towards deeper euro zone fiscal integration the prospect of the IMF getting more crisisfighting funds and an agreement to bring forward the currency blocs permanent rescue fund to mid2012 may point to some relief ahead without the need for shock and awe measures TIPPING POINT William de Vijlder chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Investment Partners believes the incremental progress made by the euro zone is too easily dismissed The liquidity which has been put in the system via the first 3 year LTRO  in combination with an overweight of low yielding low risk assets and safe havens create a huge pentup demand for risky assets he said The big question is when this will be unleashed 2012 is about spotting this catalyst Dan Morris Global Strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management is essentially in the same camp As long as Greece advances enough with its reform program for the IMF and EU to continue supporting it as long as the ECB aids the banking system and as long as Italy and Spain persevere with their own fiscal adjustment programs confidence should slowly return he said Those looking for another summit and a definitive resolution that solves the crisis will probably be disappointed On the other hand European funding of the International Monetary Fund is not yet agreed the permanent European Stability Mechanism may not get enough firepower in investors eyes and ECB money may be hoarded by banks facing demands to raise capital levels rather than lent to business or invested in bonds Possibly most crucially the lack of a European growth strategy could condemn countries like Greece and Italy to a downward spiral of recession that prevents them cutting debt Plenty of experts maintain that only much more aggressive buying of government bonds by the ECB  something it is highly reluctant to do  can buy the euro zone enough time to reform Ratings agency Standard  Poors is expected to downgrade any number of euro zone sovereigns in January and maybe as soon as next week putting a big question mark over the AAA rating of the blocs existing bailout fund However given that threat was delivered three weeks ago it may already be priced in If catastrophe is averted equities could be the best longterm bet not least because investments in traditional safe havens will almost certainly lose money  inflationadjusted yields on US German and British government bonds are all negative The State Street Investor Confidence Index dipped slightly in December but showed glimmers of optimism in Europe European investors are more optimistic than their North American and Asian peers for the second consecutive month said State Streets Paul OConnell It does not necessarily mean that prospects for the European region itself have improved but it does suggest that European institutions are more willing to allocate to equities both inside and outside Europe than they were earlier in the year Philipp Baertschi chairman of the investment committee at Swiss private bank Sarasin also believes that for those in for the long haul equities could be cheap barring a deep recession Investors who believe that a longlasting global depression is very unlikely and can tolerate fluctuations in returns should have a correspondingly high equity weighting in their longterm strategic asset allocation he said In a world where sovereign debt either offers no return or has become highly risky blue chip stocks or highgrade corporate debt ideally of companies with hefty emerging market exposure remain many money managers investments of choice But given all the uncertainties  who could have predicted the Arab Spring this time last year or the devastation wreaked on Japan  picking the right moment to dive in will be hairraising A very nasty outcome with a collapse of the euro zone triggering a steep global recession perhaps exacerbated by structural problems in China is not impossible HSBC global equity strategists said in a note But since equity valuations are inexpensive

05/08/2012,Natural gas price plunge puts heat on producers, Reuters  A steep drop in natural gas prices is squeezing the profits of producers such as Southwestern Gas Corp  SWXN  EXCO Resources  EXCN  and Quicksilver Resources  KWKN  which may need to shut wells raise cash cut staff or seek merger partners in the coming year   Spot natural gas futures dipped below 300 per million British Thermal units on Friday the lowest level in more than two years as a glut of gas from shale fields across the United States pushed inventory levels to historic highs Market forecasters expect prices to remain weak in 2012 after falling nearly 40 percent since June  a boon to major users of the fuel such as chemicals and industrial companies Large gas producers including Exxon Mobil Corp  XOMN  and Chevron Corp  CVXN  have the deep pockets to ride through the low prices but many of their smaller competitors are likely to suffer as they are heavily reliant on dry gas Shares of Exco and Quicksilver have lost about half their value in the last six months far worse than the 54 percent drop in the NYSE index of natural gas companies XNG Southwesterns shares have fared better since the company has hedged half its natural gas production by buying protection at around 5 gas Still the companys projections show that low natural gas prices will cut sharply into both profits and cash flow Typically gas producers respond to price drops by reducing spending on new wells shrinking the amount of gas that enters the market and helping to turn prices higher But analysts say more drastic action may be needed in 2012 including well shutdowns spending cuts or even employee layoffs as well as asset sales or full mergers with stronger peers Theyll muck through a couple ugly months of bad spot pricing as long as they see some hope in the strip said Dan Morrison senior energy analyst at Global Hunter Securities referring to NYMEX futures strip prices When the whole strip melts down thats what really alters behavior Graphic  linkreuterscommup44s Weak gas prices have sparked chatter some companies could seek mergers or sell off assets On the transaction side youve always got the opportunistic guys saying oil is at a relatively high spot in the last couple of years and gas is low so Im going to chase the gas right now said David Knox senior vice president for negotiated transactions at the Oil  Gas Asset Clearinghouse in Houston EXCO earlier this year explored a sale but found no suitable buyers It has said it may raise funds by selling its gas processing assets The company may find a willing buyer in its joint venture partner BG Group Plc  BGL  according to Michael Hall analyst at Baird Equity Research The companies are currently partners in the Marcellus and Haynesville shales That may hinge on whether BG decides to pursue a vertical integration strategy to help fulfill the longterm gas export deals it recently signed with Cheniere Energy Inc  LNGA  Hall said in a note to clients earlier this month GAS WINNERS Shale fields such as the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and West Virginia the Haynesville in Louisiana Fayetteville in Arkansas as well as new fields in Ohio and other states have pushed average 2012 prices for natural gas futures on the NYMEX near 330 this week well south of the 4 mark that gas producers often cite as the benchmark to deliver healthy industry returns Southwestern has said cash flow from operations in 2012 could fall more than 14 percent when calculated using a 350 gas price compared with gas at 450 per Mcf By the same measure the companys net profit falls more than 20 percent with 350 gas Southwesterns output is 100 percent gas EXCOs production is 98 percent gas and Quicksilvers production is 82 percent gas according to data from Bernstein Research Projections that gas prices will stay low have helped many other industries that rely on gas to produce chemicals fertilizer or electricity Steel maker Nucor Corp  NUEN  has cited low natural gas prices as a key driver behind its move to build a new steel plant in Louisiana and electricity producers have announced plans to build dozens of new gasfired power plants to replace

04/17/2012,Spain says deficit bigger than expected hikes taxes, MADRID  Reuters  Spains new government said on Friday that this years budget deficit would be much larger than expected and announced a slew of surprise tax hikes and wage freezes that could drag the country back to the centre of the euro zone debt crisis   In its first decrees since sweeping to victory in November the centreright government said the public deficit for 2011 would come in at 8 percent of gross domestic product well above an official target of 6 percent It announced initial public spending cuts of 89 billion euros 115 billion and tax hikes aimed at bringing in an additional 6 billion euros a year to tackle the shortfall This is just the beginning  Were facing an extraordinary and unexpected situation forcing us to take extraordinary and unexpected measures Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said Spain has been under market scrutiny over its ability to control its public finances and Madrid has seen risk premiums soar to record highs on contagion fears as the euro zone debt crisis spread Ten days ago the Treasury said the central government budget deficit was on course to meet a fullyear target of 48 percent of GDP which analysts said would push Spains overall public deficit above its 6 percent target for the year But the scale of the overshoot took some economists by surprise and led them to forecast a deeper recession ending the year on a downbeat note for the euro zone as a whole This is a strong shock I didnt expect this kind of deficit increase How can we achieve the objective using personal income taxes and capital taxes This means making the recession much worse economist at Barcelona ESADE university Robert Tornabell While Italys debt mountain has been the biggest concern in financial markets in recent months Spain had been seen as faring somewhat better Measures taken by the previous Socialist government while costing it the election have kept the markets from pushing Spanish yields to unsustainable levels But as recession looms across the euro zone the new government faces a rocky few years After Fridays initial round of tax hikes and spending cuts it plans to unveil a final 2012 budget by the end of March The Socialists cut the budget shortfall from 112 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 and the conservatives must take up the baton and bring the deficit down to 44 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013 If the final 2011 deficit hits the 8 percent mark as the conservatives say the government will need to make total savings worth more than 35 billion euros in 2012 to meet the official target TAX THE RICH Spains economy the fourthlargest in the euro zone is likely to have shrunk as much as 03 percent in the fourth quarter Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said this week and many economists expect output to keep shrinking in early 2012 The collapse of the property market after the 2007 global credit crunch and shrinking consumer confidence have hit the economic cornerstones of construction and services leaving Spain struggling to grow since emerging from recession in 2010 Now the euro zone debt crisis and fear of economic slump across the bloc has hit Spanish export growth the only element of the economy to promote growth through 2011 The tax hikes announced by the conservatives on Friday which they have always said would be counterproductive to a struggling economy will be aimed at the countrys wealthiest The government froze civil servants wages but also pledged to help the countrys poorest by raising pensions and holding electricity tariffs steady for small consumers Beyond deficit reduction the new government said it would concentrate its first few measures on the broken labor market which has left Spain with an unemployment rate more than double the European Union average and the banking system Spain has rapidly lost competitiveness since the birth of the single currency bloc as wages have followed a higherthanaverage inflation rate a situation the conservatives have pledged to changed through labor reform Spanish wages have risen by 208 percent in 20032008 compared to just 97 percent in Germany according to data from the IESE business school The government is in talks with unions and employers representatives to produce a reform plan in the first two weeks of January Meanwhile the banking system has been badly hit by the burst property bubble and new Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said the banks must be forced to announce losses on the housing market in a new step in the ongoing restructuring plan But some economists say that while Spain must reform and cut costs its future depends on decisions by euro zone leaders on creating a viable backstop for troubled regional economies There is very little that the Rajoy government can do on its own to bring down Spains borrowing costs significantly not least as its fiscal policies are going to depress growth further The real challenge in Spain is to get the economy moving said Spiro Sovereign Strategys Nicholas Spiro Additional reporting writing by Paul Day Editing by  Hugh Lawson

02/03/2012,JPMorgan dominates merged investment bank, PARIS  Reuters  Airbus parent EADS  EADPA  faces the most farreaching changes in its history as shareholders seek to balance French and German state shareholdings with tough new safeguards against political meddling   Europes largest aerospace group has been haunted by political pressures since its inception as an industrial counterpart to the euro currency in 2000 but is reinventing itself to try to secure greater independence EADS will now become a normal company Chief Executive Tom Enders told Reuters on the eve of a shareholder meeting scheduled for Wednesday in Amsterdam The meeting will scrap a shareholder pact that held the balance of power between French and German interests and will pave the way for the exit of industrial partners French media firm Lagardere  LAGAPA  and German carmaker Daimler  DAIGnDE  It will also give EADS its first mainly independent board and authorize a buyback of up to 15 percent of its stock plans for which have pushed EADS shares up 40 percent this year The Easter vote follows a deal between France and Germany after Paris and Berlin failed to agree on a merger between EADS and Britains BAE Systems  BAESL  last year The changes also mark a turning point in industrial policy after Germany ditched opposition to direct state shareholdings driven by its private partner Daimlers desire to concentrate on cars and France surrendered key powers over EADS strategy However the euro zones two leading economies will remain influential as major defense customers and will have powers resembling a UKstyle golden share to block hostile takeovers For Enders who has overseen a dramatic pace of change since stepping up from running planemaker Airbus last summer the ability of European countries to use their leverage as customers rather than meddling as shareholders is a leap forward The most important change is the dissolution of the shareholder pact that ruled EADS for the last 13 years and the decoupling of shareholding and shareholder rights from corporate governance and operational control he told Reuters The board of directors will be strengthened and become truly independent The agreement calls for France and Germany to hold 12 percent of EADS each and Spain 4 percent while the free float of market shares will increase to 72 percent from 50 percent That involves higher direct state ownership than before when France owned 15 percent and Spain 5 percent but with greater clarity over who controls what Analysts say the higher float has boosted sentiment towards Boeings  BAN  European rival DEFUSING SHAREHOLDER PACT After recent gains EADS shares dipped 1 percent on the eve of the meeting the last potentially run by EADS Chairman Arnaud Lagardere who stayed away from the last AGM Denis Ranque exhead of French arms firm Thales  TCFPPA  has been pulled out of a retirement spent sailing to succeed Lagardere whose firm plans to sell its 75 percent EADS stake The changes come at a time when the dreams of greater European defense integration face continuing obstacles EADS believes Europes fragmented defense sector needs further consolidation for the continent to punch its weight against US defense giants and Asian powers of the future But the failure to acquire BAE also left EADS hunting for a new strategy after previously trying to balance defense with the groups dominant civil activities at Airbus and Eurocopter You could see two phases of consolidation said Kepler Securities analyst Christophe Menard You could have the most interesting industry global takeover targets being taken by the Americans very rapidly and the European side taking a bit more time he added Enders said in January EADS did not plan to attempt a repeat of the move on BAE which was blocked by Berlin But the deals failure spurred a rethink of EADS corporate governance and removed what many insiders saw as an obstacle to growth Executing the plan remains a complex task meaning investors may have to wait through Easter for details of the buyback plan What would normally be a formality is in the case of EADS an exceptionally delicate operation since the company must avoid triggering a clause under Dutch law that would trigger a full mandatory bid when allied investors collectively own 30 percent Core shareholders currently hold 50 percent but are exempt from the rule only as long as their pact is undisturbed Over the next week the maker of French nuclear missiles must defuse its own elaborate powersharing mechanisms without triggering an accidental nationalization To avoid a mandatory bid any excess state shares over the target of 28 percent will be warehoused without voting rights in a foundation in the Netherlands where EADS is registered That will include a fifth of Frances current stake of 15 percent raising the prospect that this 1 billion euros worth of shares could eventually be sold to help ease budget problems Additional reporting by  Vincent Flasseur  Editing by  David Holmes

01/13/2012,"Michael Dell plays ""free agent"" as forces bear on PC maker", SAN FRANCISCONEW YORK  Reuters  Michael Dell likely couldnt have known when he proposed taking his company private last year that he would trigger a threeway contest between two private equity giants and one of Wall Streets most aggressive activist investors The outcome of that battle now hinges on the billionaire Texan   Few predicted a bidding war for a company struggling to remodel itself as its core market declines  let alone one that pushed its value above 24 billion Behind the scenes a lesspublic tugofwar is emerging centered on the 47yearold founder himself Michael Dell backed by Silver Lake Partners LP is the biggest wild card now in separate buyout attempts by Blackstone Group LP and billionaire Carl Icahn analysts said Both have proposed offers for the company that appear to trump his 1365ashare bid at least on paper But with Michael Dell owning roughly 16 percent of the company any hostile takeover where the founder is not given a starring role in the new company could mean an unhappy major shareholder secondguessing its strategy from the sidelines On the other hand if he decides to sell to Blackstone or Icahn it could unnerve investors by giving the impression he doesnt see any longerterm upside for the company in that deal Blackstone and Michael Dell plan to meet soon two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday Blackstone is expected to negotiate very specifically Michael Dells future role  and how much say he will end up with analysts said Neither Blackstone nor Icahn has indicated what role they envision for him and its unclear what Blackstone will want of the CEO But a third source close to the matter said the private equity outfit has considered selling the companys financing arm  which extends loans to PC buyers  to help bankroll the deal That has inspired speculation Blackstone is pondering hiving off Dells parts  a breakup that would fly in the face of the founders intention of reinvesting in and saving his company Blackstone and representatives for Michael Dell declined to comment Former Dell strategy chief Dave Johnson now leading the Blackstone camp could prove instrumental in dealings with the billionaire His exboss has credited Johnson for putting in place a solid MA strategy and they parted on amicable terms two other sources familiar with the situation say At the end of the day hes going to want to have a say whoever wins said a separate source close to the deal Hes made himself into more of a free agent Hes going to play around a little bit now and see what his position would be with each person As part of his deal with the Dell special committee running the auction process Michael Dell has to explore the possibility of working with third parties on alternative offers Circumstances dont appear to favor a quick deal The Texan native is very concerned that Blackstones offer would dismantle the company and that its vision is inconsistent with his own two other people close to Michael Dell told Reuters on Monday Blackstone said in a letter to Dells board that it would encourage but not require that the CEO roll over his equity The real question is if Blackstone wins what they do with Michael Dell said Steven Kaplan a University of Chicago professor of entrepreneurship and finance They probably other things being equal would prefer him to roll over his equity HANDS TIED To be sure the company founders sway in the entire dealmaking process has been diminished somewhat by concessions he made in return for having the company review his joint buyout proposal with Silver Lake The CEO has entered into a voting and support agreement with Dells board as part of his buyout offer which ensures that he will vote the same ratio of his total shares and in the same way other nonaffiliated shareholders decide to vote if a rival offer is put on the ballot That means that if 80 percent of shareholders choose to vote for the deal then he himself needs to vote 80 percent of his own stake for the deal But the CEO has something in his favor  no one is deemed to know the company better than the man who started it from his dorm room in 1984 and built it into the worlds No 3 PC maker Blackstone prior to indicating its interest to Dells board had made aggressive overtures to recruit Oracle Corp President Mark Hurd to run Dell if it takes over sources said Hurd said on Monday in Japan that he was happy at Oracle and was not interested Michael Dell can be an asset or a risk depends on how he ends up playing said Roger Kay President of Endpoint Technologies Associates which has a consulting relationship with Dell Any deal where hes not the CEO is riskier A new CEO brings uncertainty to the company setting back its attempted transformation  already years in the making  into an enterpriseservices provider he said The last time Dell was sidelined in 2004 when he handed the reins to longtime executive Kevin Rollins while remaining chairman the company embarked on a steady decline forcing Dells return a few years later In three years Dell went from a company that was firing on all cylinders to losing market share a major battery recall disappointing financial results and investigations into the companys accounting The bestcase scenario could be if the CEO remains a major shareholder with the new company said David Larcker a professor at Stanford Universitys graduate business school You would think he will have a serious impact on the strategy he said That might be a good thing Most analyst and experts dont expect him to quit a company he founded at age 19 He could however do so if whatever eventual plan for Dells future is too much of a departure from the one he has chalked out It may not be a large possibility but it may happen Kay said There could be some midnight or 3 am where he could just throw in the towel and say you guys take it Editing by

01/10/2012,Cyprus to shape future euro bank rescues: Eurogroup head, BRUSSELS  Reuters  A rescue program agreed for Cyprus will serve as a model for dealing with future euro zone banking crises and other countries will have to restructure their banking sectors the head of the regions finance ministers said   The approach would mark a radical departure for euro zone policy after three years of crisis in which taxpayers across the region have effectively been on the hook for resolving problem banks and indebted governments via multiple rescue programs What weve done last night is what I call pushing back the risks Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem who heads the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers told Reuters and the Financial Times on Monday hours after the deal was struck If there is a risk in a bank our first question should be Okay what are you in the bank going to do about that What can you do to recapitalize yourself If the bank cant do it then well talk to the shareholders and the bondholders well ask them to contribute in recapitalizing the bank and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders he said After 12 hours of talks with the EU and IMF Cyprus agreed to shut down its second largest bank with insured deposits  those below 100000 euros  moved to the Bank of Cyprus the countrys largest lender Uninsured deposits those accounts with more than 100000 euros face losses of 42 billion euros Uninsured depositors in the Bank of Cyprus will have their accounts frozen while the bank is restructured and recapitalized Any capital that is needed to strengthen the bank will be drawn from accounts above 100000 euros The agreement is what is known as a bailin with shareholders and bondholders in banks forced to bear the costs of the restructuring first followed by uninsured depositors Under EU rules deposits up to 100000 euros are guaranteed Three years of governments and taxpayers bearing the costs and providing the back stop had to stop Dijsselbloem said Recent financial market calm meant now was the time to make the change although he conceded there was some concern that it could unsettle markets again If we want to have a healthy sound financial sector the only way is to say Look there where you take on the risks you must deal with them and if you cant deal with them then you shouldnt have taken them on he said The consequences may be that its the end of story and that is an approach that I think now that we are out of the heat of the crisis we should take After early gains on the back of the Cyprus deal Dijsselbloems comments knocked European shares into the red while safe haven German Bund futures rose Now that the crisis is fading out I think we need to dare a little more in dealing with this he said If adopted by the euro zone that daring could also sound a death knell for a plan hatched nine months ago when the euro zone debt crisis was threatening to blow the currency area apart Then euro zone leaders agreed the blocs future rescue fund should be allowed to recapitalize banks directly thereby breaking the debilitating link between teetering banks and weak governments forced to bail them out That may now never happen Asked what the new approach meant for euro zone countries with highly leveraged banking sectors such as Luxembourg and Malta and for other countries with banking problems such as Slovenia Dijsselbloem said they would have to shrink banks down It means deal with it before you get in trouble Strengthen your banks fix your balance sheets and realize that if a bank gets in trouble the response will no longer automatically be that well come and take away your problem Were going to push them back Thats the first response we need Push them back You deal with them ESM The marked change in attitude which Dijsselbloem agreed was a shift in strategy for EU policymakers has consequences for how banks are recapitalized and for how financial markets react One of the major steps the euro zone has taken over the past three years has been to set up a rescue mechanism with guarantees and paid in capital totaling up to 700 billion euros  the European Stability Mechanism The expectation was that the ESM would be able to directly recapitalize euro zone banks that run into trouble from mid2014 once the European Central Bank has full oversight of all the regions banks The goal of the ESM and direct recapitalization was to break the socalled doom loop between indebted governments and their banking sectors Now Dijsselbloem says the aim is for the ESM never to have to be used We should aim at a situation where we will never need to even consider direct recapitalization he said If we have even more instruments in terms of bailin and how far we can go on bailin the need for direct recap will become smaller and smaller I think the approach needs to be lets deal with the banks within the banks first before looking at public money or any other instrument coming from the public side Banks should basically be able to save themselves or at least restructure or recapitalize themselves as far as possible Dijsselbloem 46 who took over as Eurogroup president only in January said he had discussed the new approach with financial market participants and said he expected that they would adjust to the new regime over time Now were going down the bailin track and Im pretty confident that the markets will see this as a sensible very concentrated and direct approach instead of a more general approach he said It will force all financial institutions as well as investors to think about the risks they are taking on because they will now have to realize that it may also hurt them The risks might come towards them Writing by Luke Baker

01/09/2012,Analysis: History casts doubt on bold Japan economic reform, TOKYO  Reuters  If past is precedent optimists hoping Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will defy vested interests to take bold action to open the country to more competition as a way to spur growth could well be in for disappointment   Japans list of reports urging reforms date back almost three decades and have rarely led to the bold action that critics say is needed to dig the economy out of stagnation Abe who got a rare second chance at Japans top job after his Liberal Democratic Partys LDP election win in December has made structural reforms such as deregulation the third arrow of his Abenomics plan to revive the economy But skepticism runs deep that he can be as successful with economic reform which experts say will be the acid test after his first two arrows of fiscal spending and hypereasy monetary policy a combination that spurred a stock market rally and bolstered Abes popularity ratings People somehow think that Japan can get by so its not really necessary to take painful steps said Junji Annen a professor at Chuo University who has sat on several past deregulation committees and is now a member of Abes new panel Weve been saying for a quarter century that action must be taken I dont think this time will be all that different he said adding the government would face opposition to reforms and might well end up taking incremental rather than drastic steps I worry that if the economy gets a bit better they will ease up on reform Annen said Proposals by a panel on industrial competitiveness and another on regulatory reform will be key to a growth strategy that Abe will unveil in June ahead of a July upper house election that his ruling bloc needs to win to cement its grip on power Abes advisers however are split over how extensive a role government should play in economic affairs Some are keen to see public funds invested in key sectors while others want to loosen the governments tight grip that critics say stifles innovation and new businesses Among the topics under discussion are loosening employment rules to make it easier to shed workers deregulating medical and child care sectors promoting use of the Internet reforming corporate governance and overhauling electric power utilities REFORM REFRAIN The list of reports urging reforms date back at least as far as the landmark Maekawa Report in 1986 when former central bank chief Haruo Maekawa and other advisers urged policymakers shift from exportled growth to open markets and to make regulations the exception rather than the rule Within months of the reports issuance foreign diplomats were complaining that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone had reneged on promises of change Taking up the reform refrain a blue ribbon panel headed by business lobby Keidanren chief Gaishi Hiraiwa in December 1993 again urged the government to cut the red tape that was stifling growth Four months after taking that advice on board Morihiro Hosokawa had quit as prime minister toppled by talk of a scandal and cracks in his unwieldy reformist coalition Much of Japans past two lost decades of meager growth  including five years under an ostensibly proreform premier Junichiro Koizumi  were also marked by promises to deregulate the economy Many were kept but many were not The same issues have come up again and again said Yoshihiko Miyauchi the chairman of financial services firm Orix Corp who served on a deregulation panel under Koizumi from 2001 to 2006 Its simple  everything we need to do and how to do it can be written up in a day After that its a question of whether it gets done or not Miyauchi told Reuters in an interview To be sure few would argue that no progress has been made Former economics minister Hiroko Ota a member of Abes deregulation panel says deregulation has proceeded It is a very slow process but it has proceeded she said citing a freeing up of financial services and the telecommunications sector as two key examples Still Japans World Bank ranking for ease of doing business slipped in 2013 to 24th place from 20th the year before mainly because other economies implemented more aggressive changes Singapore ranked first followed by Hong Kong while the United States came in fourth and South Korea eighth China moved up to 91st from 151st PROZOMBIES ANTIZOMBIES The split between advisers casts doubt on just how drastic any loosening of bureaucratic controls will be We dont have explicit confrontations and we dont yell at each other in meetings but I am sure that there are different philosophies about how and how much the government should be involved in creating the strategy and reforming particular industries Hiroshi Mikitani CEO of ecommerce operator Rakuten and a member of the industrial competitiveness council told Reuters Some panel members such as Takeshi Niinami CEO of chain store operator Lawson Inc played down that gap saying it reflected different perspectives based on companies core businesses Some like Rakuten want the government to step aside and allow innovation now others in fields where investments may not pay off for decades want official backing Others however expressed concern that Abes LDP would stick to its roots as a big government party especially if as many now expect it wins big in the July election The LDP is not a leave us alone party Chuo Universitys Annen said Its in favor of a controlled economy Former US trade official Byron Sigel who negotiated bilateral trade deals with Japan in the late 1990s echoed those doubts given the persistent clout of antireform interests The problem with the way the reform process has been set up is that there is an over representation of entrenched older industries who have the size connections and motivation to maintain the existing system said Sigel who now works for a global USbased device and pharmaceutical firm The industries of the future the industries that need a more open deregulated economy to grow and the industries that will restore Japans global competitiveness are still relatively small players if they exist at all today Their voice is unlikely to be heard in the reform debate Still Abe moved more quickly than expected to commit Japan to talks on a USled trade pact the TransPacific Partnership raising hopes history might not repeat itself The TPP decision which has helped keep Abes popularity rates at skyhigh levels of around 70 percent was followed on Monday by an agreement with the European Union to start talks on a separate free trade deal that would further boost pressure on protected sectors There is a split between prozombie and antizombie factions between one set of politicians bureaucrats and businesses who want to preserve the current system of vested interests and different set of politicians bureaucrats and businesses who want more open competition said Robert Feldman chief economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities in Tokyo I think the antizombie faction will win this time because the standard of living has been deteriorating and I think the public has caught on to this Editing by Neil Fullick

12/30/2011,Fed study says China's growth could slow sharply by 2030, WASHINGTON  Reuters  Economic growth in China faces mounting headwinds and could fade dramatically in the years ahead due to declining productivity and an aging population according to a US Federal Reserve study   Trend growth could slow gradually to around 65 percent by 2030 or it could break much more sharply to a pace under 1 percent if forces undermining economic activity combine in a worstcase scenario according to the study which was published online on Monday Over the past decade Chinas economy grew on average around 10 percent a year The GDP growth rate is the sum of the growth in employment and the growth in output per employee China faces challenges in both of these categories wrote author Jane Haltmaier a senior adviser in the Feds Division of International Finance Buoyant Chinese growth helped support the global economy after recessions in the United States and Europe and a significant slowdown in China could dent output employment and corporate profits around the world The study concluded that some slowing was inevitable although boosting Chinese education to get more kids through high school could provide an offset Most people would probably agree that the Chinese economy cannot maintain the extremely rapid growth rates it has seen over the past three decades indefinitely The question is thus not whether the Chinese economy will slow but by when and by how much Haltmaier wrote Growth in Chinas working age population has slowed and is expected to turn negative before 2020 according to United Nations projections Like other nations China is getting older The percentage of the population aged over 60 is expected to reach nearly 25 percent by 2030 from 12 percent in 2010 DIMINISHING RETURNS With 80 percent of the working age population already employed there is limited room for employment growth to contribute strongly to economic activity in the future As a result the bulk of any further increase in Chinese output will have to come from greater productivity something that faces an uphill battle Although China has enjoyed a productivity boom due to massive investment that could be hard to sustain as rising living standards drive up domestic demand for consumer goods diverting resources away from capital investment into spending Also as the capital stock in the economy grows an increasing amount of investment needs to be allocated to replacing aging plant and machinery leaving less overall for net new investment In addition slower employment growth could reduce the returns on capital reducing the incentive to invest The scope for millions of more Chinese workers to move from less productive primary sectors in the economy like agriculture to much more productive factory jobs is also likely to shrink over time The share of the secondary sector is now about half of GDP much higher than in most other countries This suggests that further movement out of the primary sector in China is more likely to be into the tertiary sector where the productivity dividend is lower the study says In her baseline forecast which showed growth slowing to just over 6 percent by 2030 Haltmaier assumed the employmentpopulation ratio stayed at current levels investment stayed high workers kept moving out of primary industries and investment shifted from primary and secondary industries into the service or tertiary sector She also sketched out four alternative scenarios slower growth in employment lower investment reduced incentives to invest and a decline in the share of highproductivity manufacturing In all cases Chinese output slowed by more than in the baseline forecast But the real damage was done when all four factors began to bite together In that worstcase scenario growth halves to 5 percent by 2020 and declines to under 1 percent by 2030 Investment falls as a share of GDP and becomes less productive employment growth is slower  and output shifts from the manufacturing to the services sector as the economy matures Haltmaier wrote It should be noted that these are all in fact very reasonable assumptions Reporting by Alister Bull Editing by Leslie Adler

12/12/2011,"GM turns to ""right-size""  redesign of Cadillac CTS sedan", NEW YORK  Reuters  General Motors Co  GMN  is turning to a redesigned longer CTS midsized sedan to make its Cadillac luxury brand more competitive against German rivals   The new rightsized CTS will debut this fall as a 2014 model joining the smaller ATS and larger XTS sedans that the US automaker introduced last year as part of a push to make Cadillac relevant far beyond its home market It showed the redesigned CTS on Tuesday evening at an event ahead of the New York auto show This third generation of CTS is really the harbinger for our global aspirations and where were headed overall said Don Butler vice president of marketing for Cadillac Our big thing that were driving for is cultural relevance he added We still have a big challenge to be thought of and spoken of in the same breath as BMW  BMWGDE  and Mercedes  DAIGnDE  GMs drive to make Cadillac a global brand took shape after the companys 2009 bankruptcy and restructuring While Cadillac has been sold around the world a prebankruptcy GM lacked the financial clout to boost demand beyond the small numbers sold outside the United States The new CTS which is 5 inches longer than the current model will more clearly differentiate the car from its smaller sibling the ATS which industry media named North American Car of the Year in January The idea is to more directly compete with the BMW 5 Series and Mercedes EClass The current CTS was introduced in late 2007 and helped upend Cadillacs image as a brand for older consumers However sales of the car fell 146 percent last year to 46979 vehicles as it aged and was squeezed between the ATS and XTS CTS has been Cadillacs backbone since it was first sold in 2002 brand design chief Mark Adams said However analysts said the Cadillac brand still trailed its German competitors The new CTS is an impressive vehicle but Cadillac still remains under the radar of premium luxury car buyers LMC Automotive senior analyst Joe Langley said While Cadillac is finally getting their house in order and could make some inroads he added the dominant German brands continue their march forward into a wide range of new niches LMC expects Cadillacs global sales to more than double to surpass 410000 vehicles in 2020 while CTS sales should rise by almost a quarter to about 64000 in that time The slower increase is due to CTSs transition from the brands main sedan to part of a more complete portfolio Cadillac executives have aggressive plans saying last year that the brand would introduce 10 allnew or significantly refreshed vehicles globally over the following three years People familiar with the companys discussions with suppliers previously said Cadillac might double its vehicle lineup to as many as 10 models over the next four years as part of GMs strategy to turn the brand into a global power Besides the new ELR plugin electric coupe due next year the plans may include a flagship sedan a small crossover and a smaller car to take on BMWs 1Series In addition Cadillac officials said last summer that the brand in two years should be challenging foreign automakers for the top spot in the US luxury auto segment a position it has not held in 15 years Officials said US sales of the brand should be double the 2010 total of about 147000 within a couple of years Cadillacs US sales fell 17 percent last year to 149782 vehicles The United States accounts for about threequarters of the brands global sales which totaled about 200000 in 2011 and 2012 down from 241000 in 2007 YOUNGER CUSTOMERS Cadillac already has come a long way The average age of the brands drivers last year was about 56 down from about 63 in 1995 according to CNW Research That compares with 52 for BMW and 59 for Mercedes The success of the current CTS whose drivers are mostly in their 40s along with the Escalade SUVs reception from hiphop artists helped upend Cadillacs geezermobile image CNW President Art Spinella said he expected that trend to continue with new models like the 2014 CTS At 1955 inches the new CTS is longer than its rivals GM officials said the new design which Adams touts as longer lower leaner was an evolution of the angular Art and Science exterior styling the brand has embraced since the late 1990s Dave Leone Cadillacs executive chief engineer said the current CTS was meant to allow GM to attract buyers who were also looking for a smaller car but the company rightsized the new version to make it more compatible with the ATS and XTS The new CTS also has new features GM hopes will lure more buyers including a twinturbo V6 engine with 420 horsepower and an eightspeed transmission  both firsts for the brand Cadillac designers and engineers also cut 7 percent of the curb weight from the current base models 3800 pounds partly through the use of more aluminum and other lighterweight materials For instance the four aluminum doors allowed GM to eliminate 55 pounds GM has said pricing for the new CTS would be up from the current model which sells for 40000 to 68000 Cadillacs Butler said the increase would be similar to what happened when the brand transitioned to the current model whose average transaction price rose 8000 from the first generation Reporting by Ben Klayman Editing by Lisa Von Ahn
12/09/2011,"Cyprus rescue marks ""game-changer"" for Europe's banks", LONDON  Reuters  If the bailout of Cyprus is a template for European rescue deals it marks a gamechanger for banks that could raise funding costs see deposits shift more quickly and delay the prospect of higher dividends   Europe signaled this week that large depositors would shoulder part of the cost of future bank bailouts after savings over 100000 euros were targeted in the Cyprus rescue package That sent bank share prices falling and pushed up the cost of insuring bank debt against default Bailin is thus replacing bailout As a consequence the cost of bank funding will increase bank deposits will become less sticky and banks must hold more equity capital to reassure their creditors said Nick Anderson analyst at Berenberg The elephant in the room has been spotted at last Jeroen Dijsselbloem head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers said on Monday that in future the currency bloc should first ask banks to recapitalize themselves then look to shareholders and bondholders and then if necessary to uninsured deposit holders Now that the crisis is fading out I think we need to dare a little more in dealing with this he said In addition to big depositors senior bondholders in Cypruss secondlargest bank Laiki will be wiped out and holders of senior paper in the largest lender Bank of Cyprus will also be hit In previous packages for Greece Ireland Portugal and Spain leaders were unwilling to force losses on either senior bondholders or savers for fear of prompting flight from banks across the region Under new EU regulations senior bondholders would bear part of the cost of future bank bailouts but that provision is not due to be enforced before 2015 Noneuro zone member Denmark is the only EU state to impose losses on senior bondholders in recent years but after its banks were shut out of debt markets in 2011 it has moved to limit the likelihood of such losses Europes banking index was down nearly 06 percent by 910 am EDT adding to a 19 percent fall on Monday and putting it on course for a fourth successive daily fall Banks in Italy and Spain two countries at the heart of the euro zone crisis were among the biggest fallers with UniCredit and Spains BBVA down over two percent Italian regional lender Banca Carige had slid over three percent The cost of insuring European banks senior bonds against default rose with the Markit iTraxx senior financials index widening 14 basis points to 181 The index for subordinated bonds  riskier as they rank behind senior debt if a bank is wound up  widened 20 basis points to 302 basis points Critics of the action on Cyprus said it had reestablished the link between weak banks and weak sovereigns and could scare depositors but others said it was long overdue Finally the EU is doing the right thing If you take risk if youre an equity holder a bondholder or an uninsured depositor you should be at risk said Simon Maughan analyst at Olivetree Securities It is the bailing out of the bondholders that has been the biggest problem throughout these bailouts Maughan said there were still risks in Spain Italy and possibly France The only way to deal with them would be to make the investors that put money in  the first place to front up he said WAKEUP CALL Deposits above 100000 euros have been at risk since the level of guarantee was raised and reinforced during the 200809 financial crisis Cyprus is a reminder that above that level depositors are effectively unsecured creditors Savers are more likely than ever to spread their cash around analysts said Its a wakeup call and deposits are likely to be more fluid if you see a risk emerging Maughan said It is now rational for  depositors to move their money to stronger nonEuro zone banking jurisdictions such as the UK or Switzerland said Andrew Lim analyst at Espirito Santo Mike Harrison analyst at Barclays said the Cyprus events could also speed up plans for countries to establish prefunded schemes for deposit insurance This could be a catalyst to more harmonization of the prefunding of the scheme he said Bondholders are likely to be more alert to risks too The concept of bailin appears to be happening quicker than perhaps people had anticipated It feels that with Cyprus it is potentially now grinding closer in theory and in practice Harrison said That is likely to increase volatility especially for banks seen as more at risk and result in greater differentiation in borrowing costs for strong names like HSBC versus more risky banks such as Italys Monte Dei Paschi which has received a 4 billion euro Italian state bailout The yield on Monte dei Paschis senior debt rose 41 basis points to 516 percent early last week after an initial plan to tax Cyprus bank deposits was announced It has since bounced around from 480 percent on Monday to 5 percent on Tuesday In contrast senior debt for HSBC remained steady at around 15 percent Banks may have to hold back on lifting dividends if investors demand they hold another buffer on top of minimum capital requirements analysts said That could dent hopes of a possible rise in payouts this year But most banks are already under pressure to hold back on payouts until they have a comfortable capital cushion and rules continue to differ across countries Norway for example took action last week to raise its already high capital requirements and implement them before most other European countries Additional reporting by Aimee Donnellan at IFR in London Editing by Carmel Crimmins and  Peter Graff

12/07/2011,Boeing 787 takes to sky in first flight check, NEW YORK  Reuters  A Boeing Co  BAN  787 Dreamliner took to the sky on Monday in a test flight aimed at showing that the planes new lithiumion battery system meets regulatory safety standards a key step in ending a twomonth worldwide grounding of the hightech jet   Mondays roughly twohour flight which Boeing said went according to plan lacked the crowds that cheered the 787s maiden journey in 2009 But if found successful the test flight will allow Boeing to go ahead with a second flight test in coming days that would gather data to be submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the new battery system Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said The FAA and other regulators grounded all 50 Dreamliners in midJanuary after batteries overheated on two separate aircraft one parked at the Boston airport and the other forced to make an emergency landing in Japan Earlier this month the FAA agreed on tests Boeing would conduct to return the plane to service Resuming flights would be a relief for Boeing which is losing an estimated 50 million a week while the 787 is grounded Airlines in Japan the United States the Middle East Europe and Africa that bought the fuelefficient jet but are barred from using those planes are also suffering Boeing is still building 787s but cannot deliver them to customers during the grounding Some Boeing officials have said the jet could be back in service by May 1 or earlier But Oliver McGee an aerospace and mechanical engineer who was a deputy assistant secretary of transportation under President Bill Clinton said he was skeptical that regulators would allow service to resume so soon Take whatever date is agreed upon and add three to six months to it McGee told Reuters I dont think that youre going to see any type of quick fix or compromising on the FAA side McGee said the trauma of the Columbia and Challenger shuttle disasters would make federal officials reluctant to sign off on the new battery system until they were absolutely sure it would work as Boeing promised The US National Transportation Safety Board on Monday set a twoday forum for April 1112 to examine the design and performance of lithiumion batteries in transportation  a comprehensive review sparked by the twin battery failures in January The NTSB also plans to hold a separate hearing on the 787 battery later in April Mondays flight the first with Boeings new battery system took off at approximately 1211 pm Pacific time 1911 GMT from Paine Field in Everett Washington on a planned twohour mission designed to validate that all systems on the plane are working as designed Live video showed the jet with LOT Polish Airlines livery soaring into a clear sky with snowcapped mountains in the distance It flew south down the west coast of Washington and about half way down the coast of Oregon before turning back to Paine Field according to flight tracking website Flightwarecom It made a loop out the Strait of Juan de Fuca at low altitude and speed then turned back toward the airport The flight landed at 220 pm Pacific time and the flight crew reported the test went according to plan Boeing said in a statement Once data from Mondays flight has been analyzed Boeing said it would prepare for a ground and flight demonstration aimed at certifying the companys proposed changes to the battery system The system is made by Thales SA  TCFPPA  of France and the battery is made by Japans GS Yuasa Corp  6674T  Boeing plans to conduct one certification demonstration flight using the same LOT plane Line number 86 to show that the new battery system performs as intended during flight conditions The system includes a steel box designed to contain a battery explosion and prevent fire as well as a tube to vent fumes and heat out of the aircraft Birtel said it wasnt clear if the demonstration test for the FAA would conclude Boeings testing of the new battery system which was unveiled in Tokyo on March 15 The tests are being conducted in labs in planes on the ground and in flight Obviously progress is being made on all three fronts Birtel said Boeings shares closed up 3 cents at 8485 on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when the major indexes all finished moderately lower Despite uncertainty about when the FAA will approve Boeings new battery system some experts said the revamped unit is likely to prove successful Former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said Boeing has invested hundreds of thousands of engineering hours to develop the improved battery system They dont want to put an airplane up that theyre going to have to deal with again he told Reuters They want this thing resolved They want to do it in an efficient appropriate scientific analytic way It is not in their best interests to rush a system John Goglia a former NTSB board member said he expects the steel containment box will work as expected and the plane could be returned to service in April I will give the Boeing engineers the benefit of the doubt that they have designed a box that will handle what the battery can give it he said Reporting by Alwyn Scott and Andrea ShalalEsa Additional

12/01/2011,Monsanto DuPont strike $1.75 billion licensing deal end lawsuits, Reuters  DuPont Co will pay Monsanto Co at least 175 billion in a new licensing deal and both companies have agreed to dissolve their bitter legal battles over rights to technology for genetically modified seeds the worlds top seed companies said on Tuesday   The companies agreed to drop antitrust and patent claims against each other while forging the new collaboration and agreed to toss out a 1 billion jury verdict DuPont was ordered to pay Monsanto last August Separately DuPont will make at least 175 billion in royalty payments over several years in exchange for broad access to Monsantos leading genetic technology for the development of new agricultural seed products Monsanto shares finished up 44 percent at 10379 while DuPont fell 03 percent to 4897 by Tuesdays market close DuPont officials said the agreement was a win for shareholders and sets up its Pioneer agricultural seed unit for future growth This is a smart deal for DuPont Paul Schickler president of DuPont Pioneer said in an interview Weve got access to two additional technologies that we can now combine with our existing technologies as well as the technologies that are in our pipeline DuPont Pioneer will have broad rights to important new technology that includes stacking of traits Schickler said Monsanto which generates revenues both through seed sales and licensing of its genetic seed technology to other companies said the deal should bring in far more than the minimum 175 billion as DuPont pushes the companys technology through its broad customer base We would expect them to move past those minimums pretty swiftly and significantly They were and are the largest soybean company in the world the United States for sure said Scott Partridge vice presidentstrategy for Monsanto We are pleased to have them again as a customer for our newest technology Under the agreement which Schickler said came together over the last week DuPont is to make four annual fixed royalty payments totaling 802 million to Monsanto from 2014 to 2017 Beginning in 2018 DuPont will also pay royalties on a perunit basis for Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean technology and Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Xtend for the life of the agreement in exchange for continued technology access Annual minimum payments through 2023 will total 950 million DuPont can start testing Monsantos material in the field this year and will be able to sell Roundup Ready 2 Yield in 2014 And if regulatory approvals are in place DuPont will be able to start selling the Xtend product in 2015 according to Schickler Pioneer will integrate the technology into its own seed germplasm over time he said BGC Partners analyst Mark Gulley said the deal appears to be a win for both companies notably for DuPont who has converted its legal liability for the 1 billion jury award into royalty payments that provide access to important new technology Monsanto gets a nice royalty stream and DuPont gets to remove this cloud over the stock in terms of a contingent liability he said Access to Xtend is key as it is seen as part of a next wave of herbicideresistant crop technology aimed at dealing with a wave of herbicideresistant weeds spreading across US farmland In addition DuPont is gaining Monsantos assistance in maintaining regulatory approvals for certain technologies that are coming off patent and which are already incorporated into several DuPont Pioneer corn and soybean varieties Also DuPont granted Monsanto licenses to certain of its disease resistance technology and corn defoliation patents LEGAL TRUCE The settlement comes after a jury in the US District Court in St Louis last year agreed with Monsanto that DuPont and Pioneer violated a licensing agreement for use of the Roundup Ready trait by trying to stack several traits together DuPont was pursuing a separate case against Monsanto alleging anticompetitive behavior and a hearing in that matter was set for this autumn But under the settlement each side is dropping its claims against the other Both DuPont and Monsanto hold strong positions in the US seed industry They and other competitors have been racing to develop improved crops through genetic modifications and other means Pioneer which generated sales of 73 billion in 2012 has been gaining market share in North American soybean and corn markets and its brands have been popular with farmers Monsanto which had 135 billion in sales last year is seen as the market leader in developing genetically altered crop technology and is the worlds largest seed company Monsanto introduced its Roundup Ready soybean technology in 1996 Roundup Ready crops can tolerate sprayings of Roundup or glyphosatebased herbicide And the technology has become a foundation for many key crops including corn alfalfa cotton canola and sugar beets The two companies have been notorious for their battles both in the marketplace and in the courtroom but Monsantos Partridge said on Tuesday that they had agreed to try to improve relations going forward We do not want to have fights in the court house he said We need to compete vigorously

11/17/2011,Icahn opens door to Blackstone tie-up on Dell bid, Reuters  Two of the most prominent US investors could upset Michael Dells 244 billion buyout bid for Dell Inc after billionaire Carl Icahn opened the door to an alliance with Blackstone Group LP to wrest control of the computer maker from its founder   Icahn said on Monday he has started preliminary talks with Blackstone Both sides have made bids that could be superior to the offer on the table from Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP The backroom negotiations show how what started as a plan by Michael Dell and Silver Lake to take the PC maker private could turn into a monthslong process Icahn has proposed paying 15 per share for 58 percent of Dell Blackstone has indicated it can pay more than 1425 per share for the whole of the company all in cash or partly in shares leaving Dell as a publicly listed company The Silver Lakebacked group offered 1365 per share in cash to take Dell private Dell Silver Lake and Blackstone declined comment Icahn who owns a 1 billion stake in Dell said both his and Blackstones offers give the companys largest investors what they wanted most the ability to retain publicly traded shares of Dell Southeastern Asset Management Dells largest independent shareholder and one of the most vocal opponents of the Silver Lake plan said it was pleased about that prospect as well as the higher offers Another investor Bill Nygren comanager of the Oakmark Fund added Given the wide range of estimated values for Dell shares if all else is nearly equal we believe a proposal is superior if it allows investors who want to remain invested in Dell the opportunity to do so OPTION TO KEEP STAKES The value of Blackstones and Icahns offers depends on how much Dell shares would be worth following a buyout However Blackstones offer trumps Silver Lakes outright because all shareholders can cash out if they wish to at a higher price What is more Blackstones offer to Dell shareholders of the option to maintain stakes in the company and profit from any upside is likely to be viewed positively by the special committee set up to assess the offers according to two people familiar with the matter The outcome of the auction would determine the future of Dell which was regarded as a model of innovation as recently as the early 2000s but has struggled to make up for declining market share in the global PC market A source familiar with the matter said last week that Dell had slashed its internal forecast for fiscal 2013 operating profit to about 3 billion down sharply from the 37 billion it had predicted previously Dells shares closed up 26 percent at 1451 on Monday indicating investors expect a deal to be done at a price higher than the Silver Lake bid Earlier in the session they touched 1464 the stocks highest level in 10 months We continue to believe a higher bid than the current 1365 per share offer will likely be offered but based on our assumptions a 15 per share bid may be a threshold Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um said in a note We believe a higher Silver LakeDell bid might still be a more attractive and strategic option assuming information regarding the public stub and financial services sale is accurate he said Late on Sunday two sources close to the matter said that the Silver Lake group had no plans yet to increase or amend its offer until Dells special committee comes out with a ruling on the rival proposals DOES MICHAEL DELL STAY As part of his deal with the special committee of Dells board that is running the auction process Michael Dell has to explore the possibility of working with third parties on alternative offers On Monday Dell said he had reaffirmed that commitment Still Michael Dell is very concerned that Blackstones offer would dismantle the PC maker he founded in 1984 two people close to Michael Dell said The founder is worried that the buyout firms plans would be inconsistent with his strategy to reinvest in the company the sources said Michael Dell is planning to meet with Blackstone to discuss the private equity firms bid two other sources familiar with the situation said Blackstone made no mention of asset sales in its preliminary offer But people familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Blackstone has considered a potential sale of Dells financial services business as part of its turnaround plan Michael Dells role also remains unclear in a Blackstoneled deal The buyout firm has already made an unsuccessful push to recruit Oracle Corp President

11/08/2011,Russians consider lawsuits over Cyprus losses, MOSCOW  Reuters  Russian businesses and banks that face losses from the European Unions bailout of Cyprus are considering legal action but may have a hard time making a case say lawyers who are combing through treaties find strategies to recover funds   Big depositors  many of them Russian  face losses of up to 40 percent as the result of a socalled bailin to back 10 billion euros 13 billion in EU financial aid to stabilize the Cypriot banking system Its worth trying its not going to be easy its not going to be a oneoff 24hour court case but the nature of the action itself sounds like expropriation said Andrey Goltsblat managing partner at Moscowbased law firm Goltsblat BLP There could be a basis to sue either Cyprus or individual banks say lawyers who have been contacted by current and prospective clients seeking redress People are just frustrated and  are trying to find a way to get their money off Cyprus said Goltsblat who said that two clients  one in Russia and a second Russian client residing in Cyprus  had inquired about legal options Steven Philippsohn partner at Londonbased law firm PCB Litigation said three major banks based in or around Russia had asked about the possibility of legal action We have been contacted and we are monitoring the situation and will revert to them when we have further news he said Russians are believed to account for most of the 19 billion euros of nonEU nonbank money held in Cypriot banks at the last count by the central bank in January While insured deposits of up to 100000 euros are safe big depositors in Cypriot banks could lose about 40 percent of their money Finance Minister Michael Sarris said on Tuesday Hiring a lawyer may help depositors reduce their losses If you file a suit they are going to be concerned and hopefully come to an arrangement that would be more satisfactory than if you didnt said Philippsohn There may be a chance of recovery too Still there is skepticism about the likelihood of success An earlier plan to impose a state levy on deposits which was described by Russian officials as expropriation has been ditched in favor of a plan that restructures banks and exchanges nonguaranteed deposits for shares If Cypruss two biggest banks are simply allowed to die without passing the law on taxing deposits there will be no chance to take legal action said Goltsblat Vladimir Gidirim partner with Ernst  Young in Moscow noted that large depositors would not have investments directly confiscated but see them exchanged for equity stakes in a good bank to be carved out in the rescue This is not a total expropriation said Gidirim After a year the stake might be worth more than the initial deposit Russian depositors who suffered from Cypriot authorities actions may in theory file lawsuits but I dont see substantial reasons for it he added ROUTE TO RECOVERY Lawyers say one route to take action would be to use a bilateral investment treaty to show that investments must be protected Russias investment treaty with Cyprus has not been ratified however so another option could be via treaties with other countries where Russian firms may have vehicles It could well be that some of the vehicles that lost the money  for example companies that have been formed by Russians in the British Virgin Islands or Jersey  may have a bilateral investment treaty and it may be a breach if we can demonstrate that people have been treated unfairly said Philippsohn A second option could be to take legal action under international public law via the International Court of Justice A case would need to be brought by Russia on behalf of its people lawyers say Thomas Keane cofounder of Cyprusbased law firm Keane Vgenopoulou  Associates LLC said a plaintiff could argue in Cypriot or European court that restrictions on the free movement of capital violated EU law Clients have not come up and raised this but there is a growing feeling out there of unfairness and injustice that the depositors are being forced to carry the can said Keane whose firm has Russian corporations amongst its clients Statecontrolled VTB the Russian bank with the greatest exposure to the island said it was premature to comment on whether it planned to sue the Cypriot authorities The VTB Group is carefully following the situation It will be possible to estimate the consequences only after we have reviewed a package of documents prepared by the Cypriot government the bank said in a statement VTB has said that in a worstcase scenario losses in Cyprus could reach tens of millions of euros Sberbank Russias top bank declined to comment Editing by  Douglas Busvine  and  Peter Graff

06/03/2011,Watson to buy Actavis for at least $5.6 billion, Reuters  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Wednesday it agreed to buy Actavis Group for at least 425 billion euros 560 billion in a deal that cements its status as one of the worlds biggest suppliers of generic drugs and expands its international presence   Reuters first reported on March 21 that USbased Watson was close to buying the Swiss drugmaker to help it compete more effectively against rivals Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and the Novartis unit Sandoz The generics sector has seen a wave of mergers in recent years as Western governments pressure the industry to provide drugs at the lowest possible price favoring large players who can produce at the lowest cost Under the terms of the agreement Watson will make an upfront payment of 425 billion euros Actavis stakeholders also could receive a payment valued at 250 million euros during negotiations should Actavis achieve certain 2012 performance targets the company said Watson said the deal which is expected to close in the fourth quarter would immediately add to earnings and estimated annual cost savings and other synergies of more than 300 million within three years It will also drop its tax rate to about 28 percent from about 36 percent Watson whose recent US sales have been fueled by generic versions of the cholesterol fighter Lipitor said about 40 percent of its generic revenue will now come from outside the United States up from 16 percent The deal will also enhance Watsons business in generic injectable cancer drugs In a single commercially compelling transaction we more than double Watsons international access and strengthen our commercial position in key established European markets as well as exciting emerging growth markets including Central and Eastern Europe and Russia Watson Chief Executive Paul Bisaro said in a statement Watson shares rose more than 5 percent in afterhours trading after the deal was announced Its shares had already climbed more than 18 percent since the Reuters report This is a really good deal from a strategic standpoint said RBC Capital Markets analyst Shibani Malhotra Companies have to be global players to really compete in the generics market going forward Acquisition activity has been in high gear across the healthcare sector In just the past few days AstraZeneca agreed to buy Ardea Biosciences for 126 billion while Illumina Inc and Human Genome Sciences have rebuffed takeover attempts by Roche Holding and GlaxoSmithKline respectively And Amylin Pharmaceuticals is seeking a buyer after spurning a bid by BristolMyers Squibb Earlier on Wednesday Amgen Inc agreed to buy Turkish drugmaker Mustafa Nevzat Pharmaceuticals for about 700 million GOOD FOR DEUTSCHE BANK The deal is important also to Deutsche Bank which was left holding billions of euros of Actavis debt after a leveraged buyout in 2007 by Icelandic tycoon Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson It comes a day before Deutsche Bank posts firstquarter earnings Selling down its stake in Actavis will allow Germanys largest lender to free up a capital buffer that it would otherwise need to set aside to meet tougher bank safety rules The acquisition is Bisaros biggest splash since he took over at Watson in 2007 after 15 years at rival generic drugmaker Barr Pharmaceuticals The CEO has been telling Wall Street he was interested in acquisitions to boost the generics business or its brandeddrugs unit that specializes in womens health and urology Actavis will add valuable exposure to developing markets in eastern Europe Fastgrowing emerging markets are a key focus for drug companies as growth stalls in Western countries and pricing pressure increases on offpatent generic medicines Watson established a foothold in Europe with its 175 billion purchase of Arrow Group in 2009 and then expanded its European presence last year when it bought Greecebased Specifar Pharmaceuticals for 562 million Watson ranked fourth by global sales in 2011 among generic drugmakers while Actavis ranked 14th according to IMS Health a healthcare information and services company Watson said the deal moves it into third place ahead of Mylan Inc although IMS data still places Watson fourth We expect investors to be really pleased with this deal But going forward its really going to depend on integration and getting things right because this is a very large acquisition for Watson said RBCs Malhotra The company already enjoys a good working knowledge of Actavis  which used to be based in Iceland but moved its headquarters to Zug Switzerland in 2011  since a former chief executive of the group Sigurdur Oli Olafsson is now head of global generics for the US company He knows it Actavis well and he will know exactly where to focus Malhotra said of Olafsson Bank of America Merrill Lynch was financial advisor and Latham  Watkins LLP is acting legal advisor to Watson on the deal while Blackstone Advisory Partners and Deutsche Bank are acting as financial advisors and Linklaters and Clifford Chance as legal advisors to Actavis Watson shares rose to 7350 in after hours trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at 6969 1  07585 euros Reporting By Lewis Krauskopf and Bill Berkrot in New York and Ben Hirschler in London Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz  Gunna Dickson and  Tim Dobbyn

05/24/2011,Britain in recession means more woe for government, LONDON  Reuters  Britains economy has fallen into its second recession since the financial crisis after a shock contraction at the start of 2012 heaping pressure on Prime Minister David Camerons government as it reels from a series of political missteps   Britains ConservativeLiberal Democrat coalition has seen its support crumble after weeks of criticism over unpopular tax measures in last months budget and is under further pressure from revelations about its close links with media tycoon Rupert Murdoch With local elections taking place on May 3 there could hardly be worse timing for Wednesdays news from the Office for National Statistics that Britains gross domestic product fell 02 percent in the first quarter of 2012 on top of a 03 percent decline at the end of 2011 Most economists had expected Britains economy to eke out modest growth in early 2012 but these forecasts were upset by the biggest fall in construction output in three years coupled with a slump in financial services and oil and gas extraction The slump in construction and anemic services growth contradicted more upbeat news from business surveys prompting many economists to voice doubts about the quality of the official data and echoing those that have previously been expressed by the Bank of England Nevertheless the figures triggered immediate attacks on the government from the opposition in parliament while Cameron said the figures were very very disappointing He told parliament I dont seek to excuse them I dont seek to try to explain them away There is no complacency at all in this government in dealing with what is a very tough situation that frankly has just got tougher CONUNDRUM The government desperately needs growth to achieve its overriding goal of eliminating Britains large budget deficit over the next five years But this will be a challenge as many of Britains European trading partners are already in recession The figures pose a conundrum for the Bank of England which had appeared poised to end its second round of quantitative easing asset buying having said that it was more persuaded by survey evidence that the underlying economy was strengthening This could be something of a game changer for monetary policy said Investec economist Philip Shaw With the weakness in the economy pervasive  there is a genuine debate to be had over whether it is wise to suspend QE Gilt prices rallied and sterling fell more than half a cent against the dollar after the data Cameron has had a torrid time since his governments annual budget last month was attacked for cutting taxes at the top end of the income scale while taking from pensioners Newspapers and allies who once fell over each other to sing his praises now accuse the expensively educated Conservative Party leader of speaking for the few and of vanity globetrotting as the economy sputters and Britons suffer the harshest state spending cuts for a generation Things took a turn for the worse on Tuesday when James Murdoch told an inquiry that Jeremy Hunt Camerons culture minister and a close ally had numerous secret contacts with him and his top London lobbyist ahead of a controversial merger Rupert Murdoch Jamess father was answering questions at the inquiry on Wednesday STALLED RECOVERY Britains economy contracted 71 percent during its 20082009 recession and has recovered less than half this lost output due to headwinds from the euro zone debt crisis public spending cuts high inflation and a damaged banking sector Finance minister George Osborne made clear that he saw no scope to loosen the governments pursestrings to boost growth as he tackles a budget deficit that still totals over 8 percent of GDP  higher than most of the embattled economies on the euro zone periphery Its taking longer than anyone hoped to recover from the biggest debt crisis of our lifetime Osborne said after the data The one thing that would make the situation even worse would be to abandon our credible plan and deliberately add more borrowing and even more debt But the figures brought immediate attack from the opposition Labour Party and trade unions The ToryLib Dem government ignored warnings that austerity would drag the UK economy back into an unnecessary double dip recession said the general secretary of the GMB union Paul Kenny Output in Britains service sector  which makes up more than three quarters of GDP  rose a smallerthanexpected 01 percent after a drop in financial services output Industrial output was 04 percent lower after a sharp fall in oil and gas extraction while construction contracted by 30 percent the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2009 Britains Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts growth of 08 percent this year Wednesdays data shows that first quarter output was no higher than a year earlier The Bank of England has warned that there is a risk of another contraction in the second quarter of 2012 due to an extra public holiday But unlike during the previous two quarters it does not appear keen to provide further monetary stimulus due to sticky abovetarget inflation And reinforcing the divergence between official and private data the Confederation of British Industry reported the biggest quarterly rise in factory orders for 15 years in data released just after the GDP figures Additional reporting by Michelle Martin and  Olesya Dmitracova  editing by Sven Egenter and  Jeremy Gaunt

05/18/2011,Boeing profit up on stronger airliner sales, Reuters  Boeing Co  BAN  turned in a strongerthanexpected quarterly profit on Wednesday helped by increased commercial aircraft sales while industry experts praised the companys effort to boost airplane production to meet rising demand   Shares of Boeing which makes commercial airplanes and military products gained more than 3 percent to 7571 after the company raised its earnings forecast for the year Boeing raked in orders while accelerating production on all its commercial airplane programs The achievements helped erase concerns in the industry about Boeings credibility which was tarnished in the last decade by problems bringing the longoverdue 787 Dreamliner to market Investor confidence is with the company said Alex Hamilton managing director of EarlyBirdCapital So right now the street is pretty much starting to buy into the story that theyre going to be able to do it Personally I would argue that is a huge sea change for Boeing Hamilton noted in particular a recent production rate increase for the 787 Dreamliner to 35 per month from 25 per month as evidence that the company can hit a target of 10 787s per month by the end of next year Some aerospace experts including Hamilton have said that target is ambitious given the past glitches in the sprawling global supply chain that feeds that program Boeings firstquarter net profit rose to 923 million or 122 per share from 586 million or 78 cents per share a year earlier Boeings earnings in the quarter and going forward were helped when a California appeals court threw out Pendrell Corps potentially 775 million victory against Boeing in a lawsuit over launch and satellite contracts between the companies Boeing had been setting money aside in case of an unfavorable ruling The outcome made this provision unnecessary Excluding a gain related to that earnings were 111 per share beating the analysts average estimate of 94 cents according to Thomson Reuters IBES The company which competes with EADS  EADPA  unit Airbus for orders said revenue rose 30 percent to 194 billion topping expectations for 184 billion Boeing said its order backlog at the end of the quarter was 380 billion up from 356 billion at the beginning of the year Boeing raised the upper end of its 2012 profit forecast to 435 a share from 425 while keeping the low end at 415 Its revenue outlook of 78 billion to 80 billion was unchanged Revenue at the commercial unit increased 54 percent to 109 billion on higher delivery volume and an improved mix of the planes it delivered Shares of the company typically track commercial orders and deliveries At the defense business revenue increased 8 percent to 82 billion Sales of military aircraft rose 27 percent to 43 billion Boeing faces pressure from constrained government defense budgets Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said in a statement that the companys outlook remained positive STRONG ORDER OUTLOOK Boeing which gets paid for its airplanes when customers receive them has said it delivered 137 commercial airplanes in the first quarter up 32 percent from a year earlier Most of the growth came from deliveries of 737 narrow bodies Boeing logged orders for 805 commercial airplanes in 2011 adjusted for cancellations As a result it lost the race to Airbus which had orders of 1419 Boeing has pledged to strike back in 2012 with sales of its revamped narrow body the 737 MAX which features a new fuelefficient engine The plane is due to enter service in 2017 The company booked 412 net orders for commercial planes in the quarter including 301 firm orders for the MAX The MAX competes with the Airbus A320neo which also has new engines Going forward we believe it is going to be up and away as orders continue to pick up for its new commercial product lines and as production continues to be ramped up for both narrowbody and widebody type aircrafts said Ray Neidl an aerospace analyst with Maxim Group Boeing aims to raise production on the 737 to 42 per month in 2014 from the current rate of 35 per month Boeings efforts to raise production on its 787 to 10 per month has been questioned in the industry The first delivery of the new carboncomposite aircraft came last year after three years of delays The rate target appeared even less realistic in February after Boeing found a flaw on the fuselage of as many as 55 Dreamliners that needed to be corrected before it could deliver the airplanes Boeing said previously that the glitch had resulted in signs of delamination on a support structure in the rear fuselage Delamination occurs when repeated stress causes laminated composite materials to begin to separate Reporting By Kyle Peterson Editing by Gerald E McCormick Dave Zimmerman

05/13/2011,Facebook deals may add a week to IPO timing: source, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  A recent acquisition spurt by Facebook Inc may add about a week to the social networks journey to public markets a source with knowledge of the situation said on Tuesday   Facebook recently agreed to buy photosharing startup Instagram for about 1 billion and on Monday the company said it would pay 550 million for hundreds of patents from Microsoft Corp The deals came weeks before Facebook was expected to enter the final stages of what will likely be the largest Silicon Valley initial public offering ever The company has been aiming for an IPO sometime in May with a roadshow typically taking about two weeks before the stock market debut The delay adds another twist to the highprofile offering a day after the company released quarterly results showing sagging revenue and soaring operating expenses prompting at least one analyst to lower their valuations of the company Prospective investors will now have to wait about a week longer to get a glimpse of Facebooks roadshow because the company will have to discuss the impact of its recent acquisitions with the Securities and Exchange Commission the source said The SECs Corporate Finance division is currently reviewing Facebooks IPO filing and the regulator must declare the document effective before Facebook can begin selling shares The Instagram and patent acquisitions are likely not material which means Facebook will probably not have to answer SEC questions through a new regulatory filing which would have taken more time the source added The person did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the IPO A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment Facebook management was aiming to launch a roadshow as early as May 7 and for the start of trading late in the week of May 14 But now Facebook is more likely to start the roadshow in the week of May 14 or even towards the end of that month CNBC reported earlier on Tuesday That would likely delay Facebooks stock market debut until early or midJune That is because the Memorial Day holiday which is May 28 will likely mean that the stock market is less liquid and less hospitable to a new issue like Facebook CNBC said ASKING QUESTIONS Financial results filed with regulators this week have raised questions among some about Wall Streets valuation for Facebook a subject of intense speculation ahead of its IPO During Facebooks talks to acquire Instagram this month the two companies discussed a potential value of 104 billion for the social network the New York Times reported That figure would defy any standard valuation metric based on the most current financial results said Max Wolff chief economist and senior analyst at GreenCrest Capital Theyre putting out are very strong numbers but theyre not quite living up to the discussion that have stratospheric valuations above 100 billion Wolff said Facebooks net income slid 12 percent to 205 million in the first three months of the year the regulatory filing showed Total sales fell 6 percent to 106 billion while costs rose 16 percent to 677 million Advertising revenue fell roughly 8 percent last quarter to 872 million The company attributed the decline to a typical slowdown during the first three months of the year that has so far been partially masked by its explosive overall growth But analysts said the latest results suggested more broadly that the company was still figuring out its advertising business  which makes up 82 percent of Facebooks income filings showed  as it continues to reorient itself toward catering to major brands It calls into question the scalability of the business said Brain Wieser an analyst at Pivotal Research Group who lowered his valuation of Facebook on Tuesday to 75 billion from 82 billion Servicing large brands which is Facebooks growing focus is very labor intensive Facebook last year hired Carolyn Everson a former ad sales executive at Microsoft and Viacom to head its global marketing team And in February the company organized a splashy conference in New York dubbed fMC to woo marketers and introduce its brand pages Editing by Gunna Dickson and Muralikumar Anantharaman

05/10/2011,Apple growth hinges on China new devices, SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters  Sometimes even eyepopping results are not enough   Apple IncsO shares may have risen 9 percent on Wednesday on the back of another spectacular quarter that included soaring iPhone sales in China but the naysayers are still asking if the most valuable American company might need yet another revolutionary product in the next year to sustain its sizzling growth The skeptics certainly lost some credibility when the companys shares surged 9 percent on Wednesday adding about 50 billion to Apples market value but some have not been silenced Their case is based on the law of large numbers  it is going to be more difficult for Apple to grow as fast the bigger it gets  and on the unforgiving nature of the technology business that can turn heroes into hasbeens overnight The bulls point to emerging markets  in particular China whose mobile market is the worlds largest and far from saturation  and upcoming products like a 4Genabled iPhone 5 and the oftrumored Apple TV as sustaining eyepopping growth such as the neardoubling of its net income in the second quarter But the bears with a longerterm view fear that Google Android devices will eventually put pressure on Apples margins in China as they have elsewhere and wonder if Apple will be successful in tacking on another blockbuster consumer device to its portfolio Sales in China particularly are key for Apple to maintain its pace of revenue growth in the longer term said Carolina Milanesi consumer technologies analyst at Gartner Thats the big question she said referring to market share in China From an affordability perspective I think the opportunity is there to allow it to maintain that growth or at least not to see an immediate drop in sales In products TV seems to be one that everybody is looking at she added Shorter term over the next year some investors and Wall Street analysts note that Apples sales of the allimportant iPhone could flatten out over the next few quarters as consumers await the next version of the popular smartphone Apples own revenue forecast was more conservative than usual for the fiscal third quarter a period during which an upgrade of the iPhone or iPad are unlikely We note that iPhone product cycles appear to be getting increasingly pronounced with fiscal first quarter and second quarter benefiting from very strong iPhone 4S product cycles in the US and China respectively said Toni Sacconaghi analyst with Bernstein Research adding he expected the next couple of quarters to see more sluggish unit sales But for now sales of 351 million iPhones in the last quarter saw Wall Street analysts extend their love affair with Apple shares with a slew of hiked stockprice targets as concerns eased that the company was losing market share in the cutthroat smartphone market At least 14 brokerages revised their targets on the stock by 40 on average a day after the company posted a quarterly profit that blew past Wall Street estimates Apple shares closed up almost 9 percent at 610 after touching an intraday high of 618 for an advance of 103 percent the biggest singleday percentage gain by Apple shares in more than three years Apple as 42 percent of the SP 500 gave US stocks a big shot in the arm on Wednesday driving the Nasdaq to its biggest singleday gain of the year Last night Apples performance once again demonstrated how quickly Apple fever is spreading around the world and this trend continues to drive meaningful upside in the companys financial results said Topeka Capital Markets Brian White who raised his stockprice forecast to 1111 from 1001  Apple by the numbers  linkreuterscomben36s Analysts price targets  linkreuterscombar27s Insider segment  linkreuterscomxyf77s  CHINA ROARS Sales in greater China accounted for about 20 percent of Apples 392 billion quarterly revenue a threefold increase from a year earlier The numbers showcased Apples skyrocketing growth in China which made up just 45 percent of its revenue in fiscal 2010 Sales there are on track to nearly double this year with a combined revenue in the first two quarters of 124 billion That is almost level with revenue from China of 133 billion in all of fiscal 2011 Giri Cherukuri head trader and portfolio manager for OakBrook Investments in Illinois said Apple had room to grow in China but would also look to other developing countries with large populations  such as India Brazil and Russia  to keep up the pace of sales They are methodically just growing country by country both just building Apple stores in these countries and building distribution Cherukuri said Thats partly why you are getting strong numbers now When a new iPhone or iPad comes out they can rapidly deploy those all over the world In China Apple has yet to seal a contract for the iPhone with China Mobile the worlds largest mobile operator in terms of subscribers with 660 million users A deal with the carrier for the next iPhone has the potential to considerably boost iPhone sales in the country The main challenge for Apple is to penetrate China Mobiles 600 million subscribers The numbers look pretty good now but would be much better with China Mobile said Nomura analyst Huang Leping But doing business in China has its challenges Apple has faced a raft of negative publicity in China in recent years including worker suicides at its supplier Foxconn Technology accusations of environmental pollution and copyright and trademark infringement Now Apple also needs to find a way to stop users who hack into the iPhones software to download free apps or solicit services from ecommerce sites to download apps at a fraction of their cost in the App Store or iTunes Store Many deeppocketed companies have attempted to crack the Chinese market tempted by a large and growing middle class But regulations that favor and protect local businesses plus a lack of understanding of the market have stumped many WalMart has struggled against local rivals But other companies  such as carmaker General Motors and KFC parent Yum Brands  have been more successful in penetrating the market In Yums case China accounts for more than 40 percent of the companys profit MARGINS DELIGHT Apples strong results on Tuesday followed a 13 percent decline in the companys shares over the past couple of weeks that erased about 78 billion from its market value Following the earnings announcement analysts discounted worries about rising competition and pricing pressures noting the companys stronger margins of 474 percent in particular Apples margin upside has the most important longterm implications for the story said Goldman analyst Bill Shope who raised his target price on the stock by 100 to 850 Cook took Apples helm shortly before cofounder Steve Jobs died in October and was immediately subjected to a discussion of whether he embodied the same vision and foresight needed to keep the company at the forefront of innovation A smart TV  dubbed iTV by Apple watchers  is seen as the next product to drive the next phase of growth While Apple has neither confirmed nor denied it was working on a TV Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson about reinventing the television set and how he had cracked it Many on Wall Street expect Apples version  and perhaps Jobs vision  to be unveiled later this year or next year So strong is the speculation that investors are likely to be disappointed if Apple does not launch a device for the living room Cherukuri said adding however that a televisionlike product is pretty certain at this point It cant just be a piece of hardware Gartners Milanesi said of the possible TV adding that it would have to drive a similar replacement cycle as you see in the iPad or iPhone Additional

05/05/2011,Fed stands pat but says will act if needed, WASHINGTON  Reuters  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said US monetary policy was more or less in the right place even though the central bank would not hesitate to launch another round of bond purchases if the economy were to weaken   In a statement after a twoday meeting the Feds policysetting panel reiterated its expectation that interest rates would not rise until late 2014 at the earliest and it took no action on monetary policy The Fed also adjusted its economic forecasts to acknowledge an improving labor market and slightly higher inflation over the next few years The revised forecast along with a change of heart by the most dovish Fed officials on the timing of the first rate rise suggested the central bank has grown somewhat less inclined to take more action to help the economic recovery We remain entirely prepared to take additional balance sheet actions as necessary to achieve our objectives Bernanke told reporters Those tools remained very much on the table and we would not hesitate to use them should the economy require that additional support But he added For the time being it appears that we are more or less in the right place In response to the deepest recession in generations the Fed cut overnight rates to near zero in December 2008 and more than tripled its balance sheet by purchasing 23 trillion in government and mortgage bonds in two rounds of socalled quantitative easing Bernanke said the central bank could be spurred into doing more if the US unemployment rate which stood at 82 percent last month failed to keep moving lower Fresh projections released by the central bank showed the most dovish officials no longer want to put off a rate increase until 2016 The Fed said seven officials believe it would be appropriate to raise borrowing costs in 2014 up from five officials in January while only four wanted to wait longer down from six Interestrate futures showed traders now betting the first rate hike would come in March 2014 a month sooner than earlier thought It looks like the more positive data over the past few months has affected the people at the more dovish end of the spectrum said Sean Incremona an economist at 4Cast in New York Colin Lundgren head of fixed income at Columbia Management in Minneapolis said I wouldnt call it hawkish Its more that they are less dovish A poll of 12 big Wall Street bond dealers put chances of a further easing of monetary policy at just 28 percent Separately economists at Nomura which had previously expected the Fed to buy more bonds said they now anticipated no action Prices for longterm US government debt ended slightly lower as investors pulled back bets on further bond buying Stocks closed higher as a near doubling of profits at Apple fueled optimism Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker who is known for his hawkish stance on inflation dissented against the central banks policy decision saying he believed rates would need to rise sooner than late 2014 He has now dissented at all three of the policy meetings the Fed has held this year INFLATION SPIKE SEEN TEMPORARY US economic growth has been just firm enough to weaken the case for additional stimulus through Fed bond purchases Gross domestic product expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter but economists expect that it slowed to around a 25 percent pace in the first three months of this year The Commerce Department will provide its initial reading on firstquarter GDP on Friday The Fed described the economy as expanding moderately just as it did last month and noted that the unemployment rate had declined but remains elevated In March it had said the jobless rate had declined notably The central bank bumped up its growth forecast for 2012 but lowered it for the next two years The forecast showed the central bank expects the jobless rate to fall faster than it did previously It also sees inflation higher over the next few years than it saw in January with a notable rise in its forecasts for this year that takes into account a runup in gasoline prices Still the Fed does not expect inflation to breach its 2 percent target Policymakers nodded to some signs of improvement in the housing sector and while repeating that they expect moderate economic growth in coming quarters said the recovery should then pick up gradually To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate the committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy the Fed said As officials gathered the government reported that orders for longlasting manufactured goods plunged 42 percent in March the biggest drop since the economy was nosediving in early 2009 The data was the latest to suggest the economy lost momentum as the first quarter drew to a close Writing by  Jonathan Spicer  Editing by  Andrea Ricci   Tim Ahmann  Leslie Adler

04/25/2011,Class catches Cameron foes scent blood, LONDON  Reuters  Derided as an arrogant posh boy by a member of his own party to cap a terrible month of headlines British Prime Minister David Cameron is in danger of slipping past a point of no return as blunders pile up and friends turn to foes   Powerful newspapers and allies who once fell over each other to sing his praises now accuse the expensively educated Conservative Party leader of speaking for the few and of vanity globetrotting as the economy sputters and Britons suffer the harshest state spending cuts for a generation Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who dont know the price of milk said Conservative lawmaker Nadine Dorries in an excoriating attack this week on the premier and his finance minister George Osborne the heir to a baronetcy But they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse no contrition and no passion to want to understand the lives of others  and that is their real crime Pinning a label on them that may haunt the efforts of the two men to play down their privileged backgrounds Dorries has crystallized worries among Conservatives  who largely abandoned aristocratic leadership half a century ago  that Cameron and his posh friend risk losing them the next election in 2015 There has been as yet no overt internal move to challenge him nor any clear shift in opinion polls to show Labour able to win back the power it lost in 2010 after 13 years in office But that broadside from Dorries who makes much of her own modest upbringing tapped a wider grim mood in the party even among those with little time for Dorries herself an outspoken rightwinger Even a broken clock is right occasionally was among a torrent of approval on Twitter for her comments ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE Disparities in Britains classconscious society  where breeding wealth and schooling still dictate the fortunes of vast swathes of the nation  are widening as the government forces through an austerity program to tackle a record budget deficit and assure creditors jittery over the euro debt crisis In such difficult times it is easy to see why Cameron has struggled to shrug off the electorally toxic posh tag which contrasts sharply with those who have led the Conservatives since the 1960s when the party ditched much of its aristocratic baggage in order to survive in a more egalitarian society Educated at Eton arguably Britains most exclusive school Cameron can trace his descent from King William IV  his lineage the fruit of an 18thcentury affair with a bawdy Irish actress Camerons father was a wealthy stockbroker and his mother the daughter of a baronet  as is Camerons wife Samantha whose stepfather is a viscount from the moneyed Astor dynasty Both Cameron 45 and Osborne 40 were members while at Oxford University of the Bullingdon Club an exclusive 200yearold dining society notorious for its boisterous drinking Compare that to Tory premiers of the recent past builders son Edward Heath who succeeded the last earl to lead the party in 1965 his rival Margaret Thatcher the grocers daughter and John Major in the 1990s whose education ended at the age of 16 Camerons fall from grace cannot be laid at the door of his background alone It has come amid a Europewide backlash against austerity measures which has savaged incumbent leaders and this week crippled French Presidents Nicolas Sarkozys reelection prospects and toppled the Dutch government But with the coalition with the Liberal Democrats under strain  a reflection of Camerons failure to lead his party to outright victory in 2010  and other problems rising there is a sense among Conservatives that something must change BAD TO WORSE It looks pretty bad said a Conservative member of parliament who would discuss the topic only on condition of anonymity But I genuinely think things are going to get worse than this as cuts such as they are start really biting The furor over Camerons failings comes at the end of a month of blunders that has seen the word omnishambles  coined on a satirical TV show about a government that stumbles from one crisis to another  enter common parlance Among the bad headlines for Cameron were those relating to a woman who accidentally set herself alight after ill thoughtout government advice to store petrol at home in response to a threatened fuel supply strike Osbornes annual budget was also torn apart by critics fuming over a tax cut for the highest earners and a granny tax limiting help for pensioners The prime minister has also been hit by a scandal in which a party treasurer was secretly filmed offering journalists posing as millionaires a private dinner engagement with him and Samantha at 10 Downing Street in exchange for large donations reinforcing Camerons image as the linchpin of an rich clique On Monday a contrite Cameron attempted what was billed as a fightback promising to learn from his recent experiences You have difficult weeks or difficult months I want us to raise our game and do better he told the BBC In two years to have a couple of bad months is not surprising That cut little ice with one of Camerons newest most influential and harshest critics  media mogul Rupert Murdoch the Australianborn Americanbased owner of Britains widely read Sun and Times newspapers If David Cameron thinks his government only has to raise its game he is badly mistaken said the Sun newspaper in its Tuesday editorial it called Cameron divorced from the lives of Britons and urged him to speak for the many not the few Murdoch who is fighting his own corner after a scandal over phonehacking engulfed his News of the World tabloid last year once backed Cameron But a cozy relationship in which the Sun editor and Murdochs businesswoman daughter were part of a Chipping Norton set around Camerons country home appears to have cooled in the light of investigations into the scandal Unfortunately for the prime minister Murdoch  whose Sunday Times broke the party funding affair  is not going quietly This week he mocked government policy as mad and last month slammed his enemies as old toffs and rightwingers And on Tuesday Murdochs son James revealed to an inquiry embarrassing details of contacts with the Conservative minister who was last year reviewing whether to let the family extend its interests in pay TV group BSkyB That sparked more damaging headlines and intense pressure on Cameron to fire the minister The Suns multipage bashing of Osbornes budget speech  in which it called the event a 58minute kicking for hardworking families  gave the Conservatives a taste of what life may be like without the support of the popular press THE WAY OUT Cameron is far from universally loved by his centreright party whose grandees have been willing to tolerate his more centrist conservative instincts to keep the coalition governments leftleaning Liberal Democrat party members happy His recent woes have tickled rebels in the Conservative ranks and rekindled longstanding concerns that Cameron lacks ideological conviction and dedication to his job  that he is obsessed with style rather than substance A former PR executive Cameron put the past months gaffes down to presentational mistakes an explanation that will rile those in his party who see deeper flaws Famed for his lighttouch leadership Cameron has also been criticized for acting more like a chairman than a chief executive aloof from the fray and delegating the nittygritty of running the country to civil servants There is a question whether civil servants do too much I dont like it the Conservative lawmaker who did not want to be named told Reuters Another Conservative parliamentarian again speaking on condition of anonymity said Cameron had had his wake up call Its a sign that we do need to sort things Some of this would be helped by having a more coherent narrative A clearer set of ideas A clearer vision of what kind of country were trying to create the second lawmaker said Camerons pet project the muchtrumpeted  and much lampooned  Big Society in which people rely more on each other and a sense of communal charity and less on the state is little understood by many Conservatives let alone voters Yet for all the grumbling the prime minister may have one saving grace Labour whose leader Ed Miliband is even less popular than Cameron after less than two years in charge has failed to make capital out of Camerons woes so far My guess is the last month is not a game changer partly because Labour doesnt actually at the moment have a credible alternative said the second Conservative lawmaker Im confident we can win the London mayoralty and that will do a lot to restore confidence London mayor Boris Johnson a Conservative and fellow Old Etonian and former Bullingdon Club member is favorite to win reelection next week a result that would both soothe Tory nerves and some say keep a potential rival to Cameron out of the Palace of Westminster for the next few years With the capital also hosting big celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth as well the Olympic Games Cameron will surely be hoping that a summer of aristocratic pageantry and popular mass entertainment can drive this worst of months from the nations memory Additional reporting by Matt Falloon Editing by Alastair

04/13/2011,Analysis: How gray area of bribery law could play out in Wal-Mart, Reuters  When is a bribe not a bribe According to US law it might not be a bribe if a company paid a little something under the table to a foreign official to encourage him to speed up a permit that he would have issued anyway   Some legal experts are wondering whether this littleknown exception to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could come into play in the case of WalMart Stores Inc  WMTN  which is facing allegations that executives at its Mexican subsidiary paid off officials in that country to obtain building permits  actions that allowed the company to grow quickly in the local market Under the law it is illegal to bribe foreign officials to obtain business But there is an exception for facilitation payments also known as grease payments made to speed up routine government actions WalMart could theoretically argue that at least some of the alleged payments fall under that exception and therefore were not illegal under US law No charges have been brought in connection with the case The New York Times reported on Saturday that the retailers own investigators found a paper trail of hundreds of payments totaling more than 24 million but that company leaders essentially shut down the probe and failed to alert US or Mexican law enforcement officials A WalMart spokesman declined to comment on a possible defense In a statement on Tuesday the company said it has taken several actions in the last year to investigate the matter and strengthen the companys compliance with the FCPA IDnL3E8FOA2L While broadly prohibiting bribery abroad the FCPA makes an exception for grease payments which are defined as payments made to facilitate or expedite the performance of a routine government action When the act was passed in 1977 Congress was aware of a variety of payments that companies were making to foreign officials The Securities and Exchange Commission had found that more than 300 US companies had made improper foreign payments involving hundreds of millions of dollars The payments Congress concluded were bad for business and hurt the image of the United States abroad The grease payment exception nodded to the reality that even though petty corruption is objectionable given the somewhat limited resources of law enforcement it would not be practical to target it But the exception can be open to interpretation Because the risks of going to trial for a company are great businesses typically seek to negotiate a settlement That leaves the task of interpreting the FCPA to prosecutors not a judge It is the prosecutor who decides whether the alleged wrongdoing falls under the exemption and in recent years prosecutors have defined the exemption narrowly according to defense lawyers STRATEGY SHIFT Recognizing this development companies have shifted their response to FCPA inquiries said Alexandra Wrage president of the antibribery resource association TRACE International Inc Companies are increasingly reluctant to head into the Department of Justice using a facilitating payment exception as a defense Wrage said There have been at least two cases that have addressed the kinds of payments allowed under the FCPA according to Michael Koehler an FCPA scholar at Butler University and author of the FCPA Professor blog The bestknown decision about what payments are allowed under the FCPA came from the New Orleansbased 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2004 The opinion did not address grease payments specifically but considered rather what is necessary to show whether payments were made to obtain business In the case two former American Rice Inc executives were accused of bribing Haitian officials with tens of thousands of dollars to reduce duties and taxes on the companys rice To carry out the scheme the defendants allegedly instructed subordinates to generate false business records and to deliver cash in sealed envelopes to the officials The lower court judge dismissed the indictment finding that as a matter of law the payments were not targeted by the FCPA because they were not used to obtain or retain business If a case against WalMart were to be filed the company could make the same argument However the argument did not fly in the 5th Circuit which reversed the lower court in the American Rice case The appeals court found that under certain circumstances the bribes could be viewed as falling within the purview of the statute After the case was sent back to the lower court the two executives were convicted at trial In a 2002 case two former executives at Baker Hughes Inc an oilfield services company successfully argued that bribes they allegedly authorized did not violate the FCPA The executives had been charged with authorizing payments to Indonesian officials to reduce a tax assessment for an Indonesian company owned by Baker Hughes But US District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston concluded that the payments did not violate the FCPA because they did not help Baker Hughes obtain or retain business WalMart could have a very valid legal defense according to Koehler He said WalMart could argue that the payments under scrutiny were grease payments and did not involve obtaining or retaining business from the government The alleged payments for building permits were arguably for services that the company would get anyway The purpose of the payments was to get licenses and permits faster said Koehler But others disagree Michael Volkov a former federal prosecutor and FCPA expert said that alleged payments in the WalMart case were clearly not allowed under the statute because the payments were used to influence the discretion of government officials and to gain a business advantage Making an argument that the payments were allowed under facilitating payments exception he said would be like trying to take a boulder and fit into a hole the size of a pebble Reporting by Andrew

03/23/2011,Small banks in bailout pool under pressure, WASHINGTON  Reuters  More than 100 smaller banks were able to tap government programs to pay off bailout money they received during the financial crisis but those still owing face a perilous future a federal watchdog said on Wednesday   In its latest quarterly report to Congress the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program known as SIGTARP noted that as of March 31 there were still 351 regional and community banks in the bailout program Banks had to agree to give the Treasury Department an ownership interest in the form of preferred stock and warrants to buy more stock as a condition of receiving bailout money They have to buy the stock back to exit the program SIGTARP noted that 137 banks were able to refinance out of the bailout program by using money they received through another program the Small Business Lending Fund which was set up in 2010 to let Treasury make capital investments in banks and so boost credit availability for small businesses The report notes that the hundreds of banks left behind still owing bailout money are mostly smaller and they face a new risk because dividend payments that they are required to pay the government nearly double in late 2013 to 9 percent from 5 percent Smaller banks typically have a harder time raising capital than big banks and are more reliant on lending in smaller communities many of which still are recovering from the severe recession the economy endured as part of the financial crisis The increased dividend kicks in after a bank has been in the bailout program for five years and was intended to be an incentive to pay off bailout money though it now is a fastapproaching new burden for those unable to do so SIGTARP said there were signs that some community banks were facing a squeeze as the healthy banks leave the bailout program and the lesshealthy remain in it Of the 351 banks remaining in TARP as of March 31 2012 there were 163 or 46 percent that were not current in making dividends and interest payments totaling 306 million the report said It noted that industry experts predict a wave of mergers and takeovers among community banks in the next three to five years Some 95 of the banks still owing TARP money had missed six or more payments That gives Treasury the right to appoint directors to their boards though it had done so only at nine banks by March 31 SIGTARP said it had already recommended to the Treasury that it prepare a clear TARP exit path for the remaining community banks and it consider amending terms of the contracts for banks unable to get out before higher dividend payments start Getting these banks back on their feet without Government assistance must remain a high priority of Treasury and the federal banking regulators SIGTARP said Reporting By  Glenn Somerville  Editing by  Neil Stempleman 
03/22/2011,Analysis: Politics force growth back on to Europe's agenda, LONDON  Reuters  Its early days but powerful political currents could be sweeping Europe away from its hairshirt obsession with reducing debt and deficits regardless of the economic cost   Any course correction will be a tug on the tiller rather than a Uturn The euro zone will not suddenly abandon budget discipline and spend its way back to growth as Germany Europes paymaster would not stand for it Nor in their current mood would the bond markets But one threepronged strategy under discussion according to economists and academics would give governments more time to lower their budget deficits to the mandated threshold of 3 percent of national output in return for a demonstrated commitment to farreaching reforms that improve growth over the medium term At the same time more funds would be mobilized from the European Union budget and the European Investment Bank to finance infrastructure and other development schemes boosting the euro areas chronically weak demand If all went well the vicious circle of contracting output triggering ever more growthsapping budget cuts to meet selfimposed deficit reduction targets would be broken Andre Sapir a scholar at Bruegel an influential think tank in Brussels believes a political commitment to a deal along these lines if not agreement on a detailed package could crystallize in time for the next meeting of EU leaders in June We are headed for a June summit where there will be a growth initiative of some sort Sapir said MESSAGE RECEIVED Pressure on Europe to take it easier on fiscal retrenchment has been growing The impeccably orthodox International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have both warned of the economic dangers of overrapid budget cuts But international institutions do not vote Its the ballot box that is transforming the debate On Sunday candidates broadly opposed to the EU won almost 30 percent of votes in the first round of Frances presidential election Socialist candidate Francois Hollande who has promised to add a progrowth dimension to the EUs fiscal discipline treaty is favorite to beat incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the second round on May 6 Greeks elect a new parliament on the same day and opinion polls suggest that as in France fringe parties will do well because of popular fatigue with austerity Sapir said the challenge for mainstream politicians was to craft a package that switches the focus from shortterm austerity to mediumterm sustainability of public finances Winning the agreement of Germany and other disciplineminded countries to allow more time for deficit reduction would be difficult But Sapir saw scope for a tradeoff if freespending governments were making reforms to tackle labor market rigidities and critical budget problems related to ageing notably spending on pensions and health care There are already signs of a marginal shift in official thinking in this direction according to Riccardo Barbieri chief European economist at Mizuho in London The European Commission softened Spains 2012 deficit reduction target after Madrid brusquely rejected its initial proposal as too demanding For its part Italy is postponing its goal for achieving a balanced headline budget  presumably with the blessing of the Commission the EUs executive arm which is due to rule soon on the viability of each member countrys plans Barbieri would go further and allow governments in budget planning to use more optimistic forecasts of their countries economic growth potential if they can show convincingly that they are making fundamental changes to how their economies work Personally I would hope to see a change in the fiscal approach he said I would favor a more explicit policy that combines in an intelligent way deficit reduction goals with structural reforms ALL EYES ON GERMANY Watering down the euro zones new fiscal compact would be difficult for German Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept But the collapse of the Dutch coalition government after it failed to win enough support for budget cuts was likely to make an impression on fellow fiscal hawks said Malcolm Barr an economist with JP Morgan in London As a result Germany and the European Central Bank would probably tolerate some slippage in nearterm fiscal targets in return for a program of structural reforms and acceptance of the fiscal compacts mediumterm rules Barr said in a note Such reforms are all well and good they are indispensable for reversing the divergence in economic performance within the euro zone that has brought the single currency close to collapse But Philip Whyte a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform a London thinktank is skeptical that the euro zone can regain the path of growth unless it corrects what he sees as fatal flaws in the design of the single currency In the absence of a fiscal union similar to that in the United States heavily indebted euro zone members such as Spain and Italy are vulnerable to sudden stops in privatesector capital flows robbing them of policy autonomy Whyte argued The euro zone would still be working as an austerity machine without the fiscal compact because flaws in the structure force countries to pursue selfdefeating economic policies he said George Magnus senior economic adviser to UBS in London agreed that fiscal integration was necessary to put the euro zone on a stable footing the other requirements were panEuropean banking supervision and a recovery of competitiveness by the euro zone periphery to drive growth Crucial in this last respect Magnus said would be the recognition by Germany that it must tolerate higher inflation to help its southern neighbors narrow differentials in real costs without driving their economies into a deep recession Would Germany with its loathing of inflation ever sign up for such a program In the course of the euro zone debt and banking crisis Berlin has drawn red lines more than once only to cross them in extremis But even if Hollande wins the French presidency and follows a growth agenda that attracts broad support from the euro zone periphery Magnus said Germany would have great difficulty yielding power in the three areas he identified as critical The spectre of a euro breakup fills most people with dread so it is assumed the Germans will ultimately do whatever they have to do in order to keep the euro together But this is beginning to test the limits of realpolitik in a serious way Magnus said editing by David

03/17/2011,Powerful but obscure Tax Court lags on access, WASHINGTON  Reuters  Unless you are a tax lawyer the granite building with bronzetinted windows that looms over Washingtons I395 freeway may be the most influential courthouse youve never heard of   The Tax Court is a powerful but obscure institution that has been opening itself up to the public but only very slowly and it still lags behind other courts on access The court hears cases that range from warring spouses to highstakes challenges by major corporations to the practices of the taxcollecting Internal Revenue Service One case that could be decided any day for instance is a dispute involving Medtronic Inc and nearly 1 billion in taxes the IRS says the medical devices maker owes in relation to its Puerto Rican subsidiary Another soontobedecided case puts more than 350 million at stake in a fight between PepsiCo Inc and the IRS over how the beverages company financed a 1996 reorganization Set up in 1924 the Tax Court makes decisions that shape tax law and guide corporate America Yet its steady flow of legal filings is harder to access than filings at other courts The Tax Courts orders and opinions are readily available online but documents filed as part of its proceedings are not Seeing these filings requires either a trip to the court to search its sole public computer or a request in writing By contrast proceedings of district appellate and bankruptcy courts are on the Web through the widely used paid site known as PACER or Public Access to Court Electronic Records run by the Administrative Office of the Courts Tax Court officials say they have good reason to be less open to the public They say they must balance openness with the need to protect taxpayer privacy About threequarters of the courts cases involve small taxpayers representing themselves Personal tax records are confidential so the court needs to respect that Judge Mark Holmes and other officials told Reuters All of our publicly available records apart from the very occasionally sealed cases are available here at the courthouse just like in the old days Holmes on the court since 2003 said There are some problems with that I understand ONLINE in 2008 The court was slow to provide easy access to its opinions and orders on the Internet doing so only in 2008 years after other courts went online In June 2011 the Tax Court put orders issued by the court online in a searchable way for free without limits But that excludes filings from aggrieved corporations or the IRS including petitions responses depositions and the like Copies of Tax Court documents cost 50 cents a page  five times the fee charged by PACER Sophisticated corporate lawyers have found ways to navigate the system although some say it still can be frustrating They are moving in a direction of creating greater access but it is slow and deliberate said George Hani a tax lawyer at Miller  Chevalier who earlier was a Treasury attorney and an IRS counsel Given the power of the court more accountability is in order said Leandra Lederman a tax professor at Indiana University who has been a court critic The transparency is a really important policy issue said Lederman who clerked at the court Lederman said a big improvement would be to put the court under the auspices of the Administrative Office of the Courts which would put the courts documents on PACER TAX COURT CLASHES About 90 percent of all socalled IRS deficiency cases  in which the government says a taxpayer owes money in taxes  go through the Tax Court according to the IRS These cases can have a major impact on tax policy A case involving employee stock options used by technology company Xilinx Inc that began in Tax Court is seen as guiding IRS policy on tax treatment of subsidiaries Tax lawyers say a clash between the IRS and software company Veritas now part of Symantec Corp pushed the IRS to settle socalled transfer pricing cases rather than take them to court It is probably the most important court in interpreting tax law short of the Supreme Court because our mission is to create a uniform body of precedent for the country as a whole Judge Holmes said The courts primary allure In district courts which are the general trial courts in the United States a taxpayer must first pay the government the taxes it wants then dispute the payment and hope for a refund In Tax Court a 60 fee gets the taxpayers case moving and puts any disputed payment on hold There are other differences A DIFFERENT ARTICLE The Tax Court began as a board of judges set up as an independent federal agency to hear tax disputes in 1924 In 1969 Congress removed its administrative agency status Chief Judge John Colvin is one of 19 presidentially appointed Tax Court judges who can serve multiple 15year terms but are not appointed for life like most other judges Colvin was originally appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 Colvin who was tax counsel for Senate Republicans before joining the court has been chief judge since 2006 The Tax Court operates under a different article of the Constitution than most of the judicial branch does It has its own distinct rules Here are some of its quirks  There are no juries  Rules of evidence are less stringent  The court is not covered by the rules of civil procedure or the Administrative Procedures Act  Court judges travel to dozens of cities to hear cases They sort of exist in their own world said Richard Pildes a New York University professor and part of a legal team that successfully challenged the secrecy of some Tax Court proceedings a case that made it to the Supreme Court in 2005 In that case the Supreme Court delved into Tax Court accountability in a dispute over the secrecy of reports by special trial judges who handle some smaller cases The high court ruled that the Tax Court may not exclude the special trial judge findings from the public record calling the courts policy idiosyncratic The Tax Courts practice is extraordinary for it is routine in federal judicial and administrative decision making both to disclose a hearing officers initial report  and to make that report part of the record available to an appellate forum Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg wrote in a 7to2 ruling When the actual findings of the special trial judge were made public the taxpayers were vindicated said Pildes the lawyer who represented the plaintiffs That case sent a signal to the Tax Court  if youre going to be a court you have to act like a court and be transparent in decision making said Norman Williams a

03/16/2011,GE annual meeting interrupted by 99 Percent protesters, DETROIT  Reuters  Nearly 100 protesters affiliated with the 99 Percent populist movement disrupted General Electric Cos annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday in an attack on the largest US conglomerates low tax rate   The demonstrators who began chanting Pay Your Fair Share when the meeting began were quickly ushered out of the meeting  held in the Detroit building that houses General Motors Cos headquarters  but could still be heard chanting protests as the meeting got underway After their exit Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin stepped up to defend GEs tax practices and noted that the companys low tax rates in 2008 and 2009 were the result of heavy losses at GE Capital Over the 2008 through 2010 time period we lost over 30 billion in credit losses at GE Capital and that reduced our pretax income and also our rate Sherin said Our US tax expense last year was 26 billion We are a large taxpayer we pay our taxes and we very much support tax reform As they were ushered outside protesters rejoined a large crowd of hundreds of other demonstrators with signs that read Tax Dodgers at Work and This is What Democracy Looks Like Police herded them away from the riverfront building The protesters were part of the 99 Percent movement an offshoot of last years Occupy Wall Street protests Both are loosely organized around the idea that the US economy no longer serves the needs of most Americans The 99 Percent moniker contrasts the average citizen to the nations wealthiest None of the demonstrators were arrested unlike the scene at Wells Fargo  Cos shareholder meeting in San Francisco a day earlier where about a dozen were arrested FAIR SHARE Demonstrators many of whom had traveled from other states said they wanted to draw attention to GEs low tax rate Taxes are a particularly thorny issue in Detroit which is facing a severe budget crisis that is leading to sharp cuts in municipal services Were hoping that huge corporations realize they have to pay their fair share All of our services need to be paid for and you have places like GE and Wells Fargo that dont said Greg Lyons 40 of Toledo Ohio Citizens pay taxes and if corporations want to be citizens they better start paying up Much of the ire resulted from a 2011 report by leftleaning think tank Citizens for Tax Justice that claimed GE had an effective negative tax rate from 2008 through 2010 which the company has repeatedly denied GE disclosed in filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that its overall tax rate  on both foreign and US earnings  was 7 percent in 2010 and negative 12 percent in 2009 It has not provided details about its USspecific tax rates for prior years Chief Executive Jeff Immelt reiterated to reporters the Fairfield Connecticutbased companys position that it supports tax reform including a phasing out of corporate tax deductions a lowering of the 35 percent statutory rate and Washington agreeing not to tax profits made overseas  a key concern for a company that generates about half its revenue outside US borders We are in favor of tax reform Immelt said Our tax rate in 2011 was 29 percent just as we said it was going to be The last time top GE brass faced a significantly hostile crowd at the companys annual meeting was in 2009 when the company was reeling in the wake of the financial crisis and shareholders had just seen GE shares plunge to an 18year low below 6 The stock traded on Wednesday at 1952 MORE COMPANIES IN ACTIVISTS SIGHTS The 99 Percent movement has said it plans to make shareholder meetings  a rare public forum in US business where anyone who owns a share of a company may attend  a focal point this year Organizers have said they also plan to target upcoming parleys for The Hershey Co Bank of America Corp and WalMart Stores Inc We understand the amount of economic pain and anxiety people continue to feel in todays climate GE Spokesman Andrew Williams said after the meeting We agree that there needs to be more fairness in our economy and we are focused on doing our part by investing in putting people back to work here in Michigan and around the country Populist voices are not the only ones turning up the heat on corporate America this spring Shareholders of Citigroup Inc stunned the banks management last week when they rejected CEO Vikram Pandits 148 million pay package at the companys annual meeting in Dallas A similar motion at GEs meeting passed with the support of 925 percent of shareholders Shareholders came very close to passing with 475 percent of the vote a measure that would allow them to initiate changes in the companys management with the support of 51 percent of shareholders Members of the 99 Percent movement said they wanted to be sure their voices were heard Im here because of the corporations in Washington and all of the lobbyists that have created corruption said Tim Novak 42 of Wayne

03/04/2011,"Analysis: In Wal-Mart probe a ""black box"" of possible fines", Reuters  WalMart Stores Inc  WMTN  may not find the math easy when it tries to assess the potential criminal liabilities from an alleged bribery scandal and possible coverup at its Mexican unit   Whether a potential settlement with US authorities involves several hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties or even billions will likely depend on how many allegedly improper payments are eventually discovered and the extent of the alleged financial gain The formula used by prosecutors in crafting proposed penalties can also include subjective factors such as how much the retailer cooperates with authorities and whether executives engaged in a wideranging scheme to hide the behavior from authorities WalMart is under investigation over allegations its Mexican unit paid 24 million in bribes to accelerate its Latin American growth The outcome of any potential government case will likely hinge on whether US investigators  and WalMart itself  uncover more alleged bribery around the world as well as how aggressively prosecutors apply the provisions of US anticorruption law WalMart the worlds largest retailer has said it is cooperating the with authorities investigating the allegations which surfaced in a New York Times report on Saturday The company has not been charged with wrongdoing and it declined to comment on any potential legal liability On Tuesday it announced it created a new global position to oversee its compliance with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act a law that forbids bribes to foreign officials While it is impossible to predict an exact dollar figure 10 law professors and lawyers with experience prosecuting and defending against corporate bribery cases told Reuters that if the allegations are true WalMart would almost certainly face steep fines The Justice Department can use subjective factors to determine whether to increase or decrease a penalty including whether a company cooperated with the authorities promptly fixed the problems and how high up the executive ladder the bad conduct went A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the WalMart situation as well as how the agency determines proposed penalties in FCPA cases EXECUTIVE CONDUCT Much could hinge on how WalMart executives responded to the bribery allegations The Times said that in 2005 some senior executives failed to report the bribes and even tried to cover them up The newspaper also said current WalMart Chief Executive Mike Duke and former CEO Lee Scott who now sits on the companys board were among senior executives allegedly aware of the situation Large companies typically settle government allegations that they violated the FCPA rather than risk defeat at trial They can also face private action by shareholders who can accuse directors and officers of breaching their duties or claim the stock price fell after allegations surfaced While the government typically assigns a company a culpability score that can translate into a specific penalty when it comes to negotiating a settlement its in the Justice Departments complete discretion to pick a number said Mike Koehler a professor at Butler University who runs the website FCPA Professor WalMart has hired investigators to determine whether there were bribes in other places where it operates such as China The company could face several hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties over alleged misconduct in Mexico said Joseph Hoffmann a professor at Indiana Universitys Maurer School of Law If widespread problems are uncovered then of course you could get into the billion dollar range for possible penalties he said A US case against Germanys Siemens AG could provide a guide for how a potential WalMart case would play out The engineering conglomerate paid 800 million to US authorities in 2008 the single largest US fine to date involving FCPA violations Siemens also paid another 800 million to German authorities Siemens pleaded guilty in US court to paying officials in Argentina Bangladesh and Venezuela to gain lucrative government contracts As with Siemens the alleged conduct at WalMart showed a pattern of corrupt behavior rather than a series of incidents isolated to a handful of rogue employees according to legal experts If the allegations involving the retailer prove to be true it looks like WalMart Mexico was proceeding on a policy of paying people off thats what Siemens did too says Paul Enzinna a lawyer at law firm Brown Rudnick in Washington DC The Siemens case however involved much more money the improper payments totaled some 18 billion Siemens could have been fined as much as 27 billion under US sentencing guidelines but authorities agreed to a lower figure because the company helped with the investigation That case has rolled on Eight former executives were charged in December for their alleged roles in the scheme Siemens paid about 16 percent of its sales in global fines If that percentage was applied to WalMart the Arkansasbased retailer could be on the hook for about 45 billion UBS stock analyst Robert Carroll said in a research note on Wednesday However legal experts say company sales are just one factor that would go into a possible fine Its a little bit of a black box said Amy ConwayHatcher a partner at law firm Kaye Scholer in Washington ESCALATING PENALTIES US authorities in recent years have escalated their attack on foreign bribery Other big settlements were a 400 million pact with British military contractor BAE Systems Plc and a 185 million settlement with German luxury car maker Daimler both in 2010 Overall though with dozens of settlements over the last several years the average US fine in foreign bribery cases is less than 25 million according to a report by law firm Shearman  Sterling in January If the Justice Department pursues a case against WalMart it could rely on two provisions of the FCPA It could bring charges of violating the statutes antibribery provisions the most common charge leveled against companies The government can fine a company up to 2 million per violation of that provision While the New York Times reported that WalMarts Mexican unit was suspected of making some 441 improper payments experts said that if charges were brought the company would likely negotiate an overall settlement instead of having to pay for each alleged violation Also under the FCPA prosecutors could seek to bring charges that WalMart violated provisions of the act centering on failure to keep adequate records Siemens was the first company to plead guilty to violating that provision That carries a potential fine of 25 million per violation Under another federal law the Alternative Fines Act prosecutors can ratchet up the punishment allowing them to dock companies for twice the financial gain reaped from the alleged bribery If prosecutors determine that WalMart paid bribes to get permits for earlier store openings in Mexico it may be difficult to calculate the monetary gain experts said In the most recent FCPA cases companies have paid fines below the recommended guidelines said Butler Universitys Koehler Given WalMarts alleged misconduct and the potential precedent of such a highprofile case however the DOJ would be hardpressed to go below the range he added

12/20/2010,UK PM ex-aide to be charged over cash for royal tip-offs, LONDON  Reuters  Prime Minister David Camerons former media chief Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks the former boss of Rupert Murdochs British newspaper business were charged on Tuesday with conspiring to make illegal payments to officials for information for stories   The charges against the pair who were both close to Cameron relate to their former roles as editors of the Murdochowned News of the World Sunday tabloid and its sister daily paper the Sun Prosecutors accuse Coulson of conspiring to obtain private information about Britains royal family while Brooks was charged over payments of 100000 pounds 160100 to a civil servant from the Ministry of Defence to garner details for news stories The decision to charge them is a blow to the reputation of Cameron who has been forced to defend his hiring of Coulson since a phonehacking scandal exploded last year at the nowclosed News of the World Critics say Cameron  who meets Queen Elizabeth once a week  ignored warnings about Coulsons reputation to appoint him to shape his media strategy to connect better with ordinary voters The charge against Brooks whose friendly texts and emails to Cameron were laid bare at a public inquiry into press standards compounds the embarrassment for him Asked if hiring Coulson and being so close to Brooks reflected badly on his judgment Cameron said I have made it clear my regret on many occasions on this issue I have also said very clearly that we should allow the police and prosecuting authorities to follow the evidence wherever it leads I think that is very important he told reporters during a visit to Northern Ireland Since resigning from his Downing Street post in 2011 Coulson has been charged with conspiracy to hack into phone messages and perjury possible first steps to what would be politically charged court cases He said in a statement he would fight the latest charges in court Lawyers for Brooks 44 were not immediately available to comment but she has previously denied any wrongdoing They were both bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on November 29 FALL FROM GRACE Like Coulson Brooks a former editor of the News of the World and the daily Sun tabloid has already been charged with conspiring to hack into phones She has also been charged with attempts to pervert the course of justice after years in which she was courted by prime ministers from Labours Tony Blair to Conservative Cameron as the boss of hugely popular and influential newspapers This is a man Cameron with a red face over Coulson that is now turning from crimson to scarlet Roy Greenslade author of several books on the British press and a former senior editor at the Sun told Reuters The string of accusations have marked the fall from grace for two of Britains most connected media executives and have damaged not only Cameron but their former boss Murdoch The new charges stem from a wider investigation into the British press initiated by disclosures that journalists at the News of the World had hacked into phone messages on an industrial scale Facing a public backlash Murdoch closed the massselling Sunday title last year and formed an internal committee to cooperate with the police In a worrying development for the rest of Murdochs British business prosecutors also charged for the first time an employee of the Sun John Kay the papers chief reporter from 1990 to 2011 declined to comment Prosecutors said they would also charge the former Royal correspondent of the News of the World Clive Goodman for conspiring to pay public officials for the socalled Green Book of Royal contact details We have concluded following a careful review of the evidence that Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson should be charged with two conspiracies senior prosecutor Alison Levitt said A spokesman for the Royal Family and a spokeswoman for Murdochs British newspaper arm News International declined to comment Police have arrested 52 people in connection with making payments to public officials including numerous staff from the Sun the police and a member of the armed forces Additional reporting by Ian Graham in Belfast Editing by  Alison Williams 
12/17/2010,U.S. charges ex-SAC manager in $276 million insider scheme, NEW YORK  Reuters  US prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former SAC Capital employee with insider trading in a series of transactions that hedge fund titan Steven A Cohen had personally signed off on   In what they called the most lucrative insidertrading scheme ever prosecutors alleged that Mathew Martoma helped Cohens firm avoid losses and reap profits totaling 276 million in the summer of 2008 by using insider tips he got from a doctor about Elan Corp and Wyeth LLC Martoma is the fifth person associated with SAC Capital one of the most widely followed and influential hedge funds to be charged with insider trading in either a criminal or civil proceeding He had worked for a unit of SAC Capital called CR Intrinsic Investors in Stamford Connecticut until 2010 The criminal complaint against Martoma does not name Cohen but refers to him as the owner of the hedge fund and makes clear that Cohen and Martoma talked often about the funds trading in shares of Elan and Wyeth The court papers do not say Cohen knew how Martoma obtained his information Martomas lawyer Charles Stillman said his client was an exceptional portfolio manager and he is confident Martoma will be exonerated A spokesman for SAC Capital said Mr Cohen and SAC are confident that they have acted appropriately and will continue to cooperate with the governments inquiry The charges against Martoma stem from the US governments longrunning investigation of improper trading in the 2 trillion hedge fund industry which the Federal Bureau of Investigation has called Operation Perfect Hedge The investigation has led to more than 50 convictions so far most notably former Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam and former Goldman Sachs Group director Rajat Gupta Slowly US authorities have been filing charges and winning convictions against lowerlevel traders and analysts who once worked for Cohen one of the hedge fund industrys most successful and bestknown traders Authorities are stepping up pressure on Cohen and his hedge fund This summer the US Securities and Exchange Commission took a deposition from Cohen as part of an insider trading investigation It is not clear what the SEC asked Cohen about Recently a top deputy of Cohens Michael Steinberg was named as an unindicted coconspirator in court documents in a separate insider trading matter The 14 billion SAC Capital which charges some of the highest fees in the industry is up about 10 percent this year  double the performance of the average US hedge fund MAJOR REVERSAL According to court papers filed on Tuesday Martoma spoke in July 2008 to the hedge fund owner  Cohen  and recommended selling shares of Elan and Wyeth before a negative announcement on clinical trial results for an Alzheimers drug jointly developed by the two companies CR Intrinsic which in 2008 mostly traded with Cohens own money had initially taken long positions in Elan and Wyeth stocks before reversing itself over the course of one week selling some stock and building up massive short positions that accounted for onefifth of all trading in Elan federal prosecutors said The criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors and a related civil lawsuit filed by the SEC contend Martoma got insider information from a doctor who is not named in the criminal complaint because he is now cooperating with prosecutors after agreeing to pay a 186781 disgorgement The SEC complaint identifies the doctor as Sidney Gilman who once worked as a consultant for a socalled expert network Hedge funds use such networks to gain insight into various industries Gilman an 80year old neurology professor at the University of Michigan is serving as a confidential cooperating witness in the criminal case Dr Gilman is cooperating with the SEC and we expect to settle that case in short order said Gilmans lawyer Mark Mukasey a partner at Bracewell  Giuliani The name of the expert network firm does not appear in the court documents A disclosure attached to a paper by Gilman in the medical journal Neurology lists him as a consultant for the Gerson Lehrman Group A spokesman for GLG declined to comment The court papers describe phone calls in which Gilman shared detailed information about the Alzheimers drugs clinical trial Gilman was chair of a committee to monitor patients safety during the trial According to the criminal complaint Gilman scheduled meetings and phone calls with Martoma that allowed him to pass on new information about the trial quickly after receiving it He was initially positive about the drug as a result Martoma vigorously bought shares of Elan and Wyeth The complaint says the hedge fund owner defended Martoma against other people inside SAC Capital who criticized the large position After Gilman learned the drug trial results were mostly negative a trader for CR Intrinsic unwound its positions and made a move into options that paid off when the stocks fell Elan shares for example fell about 70 percent following the news of the trial results Of the 276 million in profits 81 million came from short sales and other options on the two stocks and 194 million came from losses avoided by selling the stocks before the trial results were revealed to the public according to the complaint By cultivating and corrupting a doctor who had access to secret drug data portfolio manager Mathew Martoma and his hedge fund benefited from what might be the most lucrative inside tip of all time Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara told reporters on Tuesday in discussing the charges FIFTH FORMER SAC TRADER The charges against Martoma are the latest in a string of insider trading allegations to be leveled against former top traders and analysts who worked at SAC Capital A person familiar with SAC Capital said Martoma an alumnus of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California sat near Cohen at SAC Capitals large trading floor in Stamford Cohen has long been a target of prosecutors In sworn testimony last year he said rules governing insider trading were very vague and identifying a tip as material nonpublic information was sometimes a judgment call But experts said prosecutors lack proof that Cohen knew the trades on Elan and Wyeth were based on inside information They said more evidence would be needed to make a case even if Martoma agreed to testify against Cohen as part of a deal Experts noted that prosecutors won a conviction of Rajaratnam using wire taps to show the fund manager receiving insider tips While other convictions have been won without wire taps they said a single witness testifying after a plea bargain with prosecutors would not stand up under cross examination Two former traders Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil pleaded guilty to insider trading charges last year Jon Horvath a former analyst at a division of SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in September Another former SAC Capital employee Jonathan Hollander settled civil charges of insider trading last year with the SEC Martoma was arrested on Tuesday morning in Boca Raton Florida according to an FBI spokesman He was freed on a 5 million bond Reporting by Emily Flitter and Basil Katz Additional reporting by  Katya Wachtel  Editing by  Matthew Goldstein   Jennifer Ablan  Andrew Hay  Leslie Gevirtz  and  David

12/15/2010,Twinkies not dead yet judge tries to save Hostess jobs, WHITE PLAINS New York  Reuters  Hostess Brands Inc agreed in court on Monday to enter private mediation with its lenders and leaders of a striking union to try to avert the liquidation of the maker of Twinkies snack cakes and Wonder Bread   Hostess its lenders and the Bakery Confectionery Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union BCTGM agreed to mediation at the urging of Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain of the Southern District of New York who advised against a more expensive public hearing regarding the companys liquidation My desire to do this is prompted primarily by the potential loss of over 18000 jobs as well as my belief that there is a possibility to resolve this matter Drain said The 82yearold Hostess was seeking permission to liquidate its business claiming that its operations have been crippled by a bakers strike and that winding down is the best way to preserve its dwindling cash Hostess suspended operations at all of its 33 plants across the United States last week as it moved to start selling assets Heather Lennox a lawyer for Hostess said it would be hard for Hostess to recover from the damage it sustained due to the strike even if an agreement was forthcoming Yet following the hearing Hostess Chief Executive Officer Gregory Rayburn told reporters that there was always a chance Hostess could be saved I think we have to see what unfolds Rayburn said My impression is that the judge wants to understand the parties positions and some of their logic but it doesnt change our financial position Im happy to have the help he added referring to Drains mediation following a breakdown of communication between Hostess and the union Maybe the judge will help But can I handicap how its going to go No way A lawyer for Hostess creditors committee declined to comment The courtsanctioned mediation could make both sides more willing to give said Nick Kalm a communications consultant specializing in labor relations It makes it much more likely that the company will put forward something that is less draconian and the union will take it The union realizes they are out of options said Kalm BEHIND CLOSED DOORS The BCTGM called the strike on November 9 after Hostess sought and won court approval to impose wage and benefit cuts Unlike other unions representing workers at Hostess the BCTGM did not contest Hostesss action  which allowed it to reject a collective bargaining agreement and impose its offer Given the fact that the union did not fight Hostesss motion in court Judge Drain said it was somewhat unusual to say the least and perhaps illogical that the union would then strike against it Its an odd approach Drain said Before thousands of people are put out of work it would seem to me worthwhile for both the union and the debtors to explore why that happened Drain also questioned whether the union had held discussions with competitors or potential suitors about a shiftover of jobs saying the unions response to Mondays motion implied that it sees meaningful sales available out there beyond the piecemeal sales that this motion contemplates A lawyer for the union did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on whether such discussions had taken place BUYERS MAY EMERGE Analysts have said Hostess brands which also include Natures Pride Dolly Madison and Drakes are expected to draw interest from rivals including Flowers Foods Pepperidge Farm owner Campbell Soup Co and Mexicos Grupo Bimbo Brian Boyle a food industry investment banker at DA Davidson  Co said it was hard to gauge the value of the Hostess assets given that there are a lot of plants that are old and inefficient The other wild card is whether youre going to see different buyers emerge for different segments of the business So Flowers Foods for instance might want the cake segment and Bimbo could want the bread piece So it comes down to are the parts greater than the whole Boyle said In either case significant labor and benefits concessions will be required Private equity firm Metropolous  Co said on Friday it was interested in pursuing the company and on Monday Fortune reported that Sun Capital Partners was interested Sun Capital did not return a call seeking comment The company did have a potential white knight at one point according to Hostess Last spring an outside equity investor had made a viable proposal that would help the company reorganize it said but the Teamsters union refused to agree to changes to the pension program and the outside investor walked away The company spent the summer and fall negotiating with all of the 12 unions trying to find a common path to reorganization and did gain certain agreements with the Teamsters and many of the other unions though not the BCTGM At the same time the company started putting together a liquidation plan The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc US Bankruptcy Court

12/14/2010,Euro zone mulls Greek debt buy-back up to 40 billion euros, BRUSSELS  Reuters  Euro zone finance ministers are considering allowing Athens to buy back up to 40 billion euros of its own bonds at a discount as one of a number of measures to cut Greek debt to 120 percent of GDP within the next eight years   Going into the second ministerial meeting in successive weeks JeanClaude Juncker the chairman of the group was cautiously optimistic that a deal would be struck We must still reach an understanding on several details and I would expect that the chances are good that we will come to a final and joint solution this evening he told reporters But Im not entirely certain That caution reflects the complex options being discussed ongoing political differences and the sheer scale of reducing Greeces debt mountain Under a proposal discussed by ministers Greece would offer privatesector bondholders around 30 cents for every euro of Greek debt they hold allowing Athens to pay down some of its vast outstanding obligations a senior official involved in the discussions told Reuters Greek debt is trading at 2030 cents on the euro depending on its maturity but is likely to strengthen if the buyback plan is confirmed meaning any offer will have diminishing marginal returns The ministers who failed to reach agreement last week have also discussed granting Greece a 10year moratorium on paying interest on about 130 billion euros of loans from the euro zones emergency fund which could save Athens around 44 billion euros over a decade the official said There is also the possibility of reducing the interest rate on loans made by euro zone countries directly to Greece in 2010 from 15 percent to just 025 percent although the official said Germany was opposed to such a step The range of options on the table underscored the determination to find a solution to Greeces debt problems nearly three years after they were first exposed leading to contagion across the euro zone However while some such as the debt buyback have significant backing others face opposition from one or more euro zone countries and the official emphasized that the ground could shift rapidly As well as the 17 euro zone finance ministers the meeting was attended by IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi The IMF which has participated with the euro zone in two bailouts of Greece since 2010 has said that Greek debt must be reduced to 120 percent of GDP by 2020 if it is to be sustainable in the longrun If that isnt possible there is a risk that the IMF will have to withdraw from efforts to stabilize Greece At a meeting a week ago there were sharp differences between the EU and IMF with Juncker saying Greek debt should be cut to that target only by 2022 Lagarde said that would be unacceptable On Tuesday officials began by agreeing that the aim was to cut the debt to 120 percent by 2020 the senior official told Reuters But it remains uncertain just what mix of measures will achieve that goal Under current projections Greek debt is expected to be about 145 percent in eight years time meaning measures totaling around 25 percentage points of GDP or 50 billion euros are needed to get Greece back on track Pressure for the euro zone to come up with a solution is high not just because Greece is running out of money and financial markets want a dependable solution but because Greece has taken virtually all the steps demanded of it to cut spending raise taxes and overhaul its economy It is clear that Greece has delivered Juncker said AID PAYMENT COMING As well as examining longerterm measures to put Greeces debt back on a stable footing the ministers are expected to give a provisional goahead for the next tranche of up to 44 billion euros of emergency funds to be paid to Athens The tranche which will help recapitalize Greek banks as well as keep the government afloat could be paid as soon as December 5 as long as Greece meets the last few outstanding commitments it has on overhauling its economy The payment would provide immediate relief to Athens but it is longterm debt that is the core issue If not enough measures can be identified to get the debttoGDP ratio down to 120 percent by 2020 then euro zone countries may have to examine an option none of them likes  writing off a portion of the loans they have made to Greece The European commissioner for economic affairs Olli Rehn said as he arrived for the meeting that the euro zone should be ready to do more for Greece in the coming years an apparent nod to the idea of governmentsector debt writedowns Its essential now that we take a decision on a set of credible measures on debt sustainability and at the same time we need to be ready to take further decisions in the light of future developments Rehn said He did not elaborate but the idea of a haircut on official loans is off the table for now because many countries including Germany see it as politically and legally impossible French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said a deal was at hand but everybody would have to make concessions I have the impression that a political agreement is within reach and I think it is our duty as finance ministers to get it this evening Everyone has to accept that they will have to go beyond their red lines Moscovici said A fundamental problem for Greece is growth  the economy has contracted for the past five years and will do so again in 2013 That means the debttoGDP ratio continues to rise to a nearunbearable 190 percent even though Greece is taking tough decisions to reduce it Euro zone officials have asked for a legal analysis of a debt buyback which would focus on the 60 billion euros of Greek debt owned by privatesector banks and institutions Its possible as soon as tonight its an option on the menu the official said The ministers will also have to decide how to finance two extra years until 2016 they have given Greece to reach the target of a primary surplus that would allow the country to start cutting its debt pile in a sustainable way The EU and IMF estimates that such an extension would require almost 33 billion euros more in financing for Athens which is politically difficult because of growing opposition to bailouts in many euro zone countries notably Germany and Finland Additional

12/10/2010,UBS trader jailed for seven years in $2.3 billion fraud, LONDON  Reuters  UBS trader Kweku Adoboli was jailed for seven years on Tuesday for the biggest fraud in British history which cost the Swiss bank 23 billion   The 32yearold had admitted trading far in excess of authorized risk limits and booking fictitious trades to hide his true positions but said everything he did was to make profits for UBS and was in line with the banks culture He wept in the dock as his lawyer asked the judge to show clemency describing his Ghanaianborn client as a sensitive hardworking young man who had tried too hard to do well The tragedy for you is that you had everything going for you judge Brian Keith told Adoboli citing his English private school education his intelligence and natural charm Your fall from grace as a result of these convictions is spectacular said the judge You were arrogant enough to think that the banks rules for traders didnt apply to you The prosecution had accused Adoboli of playing God with UBSs money in the belief that he had the magic touch driven by a desire to be a star trader with a huge bonus to match The Adoboli affair and the failures it revealed at UBS where backoffice staff queried some offsetting trades for weeks without realizing that they were fictitious were the latest stain on the reputation of the investment banking industry The trial exposed a trading room culture where young men in their 20s relished the rush of dealing in hundreds of millions of dollars bantering about putting your balls on the table by exposing their employer to enormous risk UBSs share price fell by more than 10 percent on the day of Adobolis arrest Oswald Gruebel later resigned as chief executive and others quit or were pushed out as a result of the scandal which damaged the banks efforts to recover from near collapse during the global financial crisis of 2008 Tom Naratil the banks chief financial officer told the court during the trial that Adobolis losses had precipitated some job cuts and led to smaller bonuses for remaining staff UBS has now axed 10000 jobs and plans to wind down much of its investment bank It says that is not linked to the Adoboli case but bank sources say it would not have happened without the management shakeup caused by the rogue trading scandal STREAK OF GAMBLER Adoboli was in the enclosed glass dock at the rear of the court throughout Tuesdays proceedings He looked grave but composed bowing his head when he heard a first guilty verdict His father John a retired United Nations official who came from Ghana to support his son throughout the 10week trial sat in the public seats just behind The judge denied a request from the defense to let Adoboli who had been free on bail to sit with his family before his final sentencing Once it was handed down Adoboli was led away by police The extrader will serve half of his sevenyear term before being released on licence Taking into account time already spent in custody and on bail subject to a curfew he could be out of prison in about two and a half years Defense counsel Charles Sherrard had pleaded for a lighter sentence arguing that Adobolis trading losses were less than those caused by Jerome Kerviel of Frances Societe Generale who received only a threeyear jail sentence in Paris in 2010 The judge however made no reference to that case in his remarks There is a strong streak of the gambler in you borne out by your personal trading the judge said referring to the fact that Adoboli had lost well over 100000 pounds 159100 of his own money on gambling and was broke when arrested During the trial the court heard that the risk exposure from his trading at UBS had peaked at 12 billion on August 8 2011 a number described by the judge as unbelievable His desks authorized risk limit was 100 million intraday and 50 million overnight at the time The amount of money involved was staggering impacting hugely on the bank but also on their employees shareholders and investors This was not a victimless crime said Andrew Penhale of the Crown Prosecution Service after the verdict Police in Londons City financial district called Adoboli one of the most sophisticated fraudsters they had come across NOT PERSONAL GAIN Adoboli had pleaded not guilty to two charges of fraud by abuse of position and four of false accounting covering the period from October 2008 to his arrest on September 15 2011 The jury returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the main fraud count holding him directly responsible for the 23 billion loss That count related to unhedged multibilliondollar trades in the summer of 2011 that led to the losses The jury found Adoboli guilty by a majority of 91 on the other count of fraud which covered the period from October 2008 to May 2011 during which no losses were alleged The judge said the conviction on that count was important because it showed that all his unhedged unauthorized trading was fraudulent not just the later deals that lost money Adoboli was acquitted on the four counts of false accounting related to the fake entries he admitted making into UBSs computer systems to hide his true positions To convict him of those charges the jury needed to be certain that his primary motive had been personal financial gain Adoboli had always disputed the prosecution argument that he was driven by a desire for a bigger bonus presenting himself as a dedicated UBS employee whose motivation at all times was to do his best for a bank he considered his family I suspect that the only reason why the jury acquitted you on the four counts of false accounting is that they were not sure that you booked the fictitious trades predominantly to make a financial gain for yourself the judge told Adoboli The fictitious hedging trades you booked remain part of the picture of what your fraudulent trading involved Editing by Will Waterman and  Alastair Macdonald 
12/09/2010,JPMorgan names retail finance executive Lake as new CFO, Reuters  JPMorgan Chase  Co  JPMN  named littleknown executive Marianne Lake as its chief financial officer on Monday making her one of the most powerful women on Wall Street and the top ambassador to investors for the largest US bank   Lake 43 will replace Doug Braunstein as CFO early next year and join only a handful of other women in top Wall Street roles such as Ruth Porat the chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley  MSN  Lake will answer directly to CEO Jamie Dimon in her new role reestablishing a reporting line taken away from the CFO post this summer after a massive 62 billion trading loss hurt the companys credibility with securities analysts She will also join the banks powerful operating committee which has about a dozen members I hope to be described as a great partner and someone who helped drive and develop the business Lake said in a interview Braunstein 51 a longtime investment banker will become a vice chairman at JPMorgan and focus on serving top clients according to an announcement from the company His move could mark the last exit from the public spotlight of JPMorgan executives linked to the trading loss Braunstein like Dimon had insisted to analysts in April that press reports were wrong about risks the banks Chief Investment Office faced from positions taken by Bruno Iksil who was known to hedge funds as the London Whale for the size of his trades in derivatives When talk of Braunsteins possible move surfaced last month a person familiar with the matter said giving up the CFO post would be Braunsteins decision and unrelated to the bad credit trades The change also comes as Dimon grooms a younger group of executives at the bank In a reshuffle over the summer Dimon named Michael Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto  both in their late 40s at the time  cochiefs of commercial and investment banking Both Cavanagh and Pinto are seen as prime candidates to succeed Dimon 56 when he is ready to retire HIGHPROFILE ROLE Lake was far removed from the derivatives debacle Though she has been the CFO for JPMorgans retail branch systems since 2009 she has had a relatively low profile outside the bank She has not been a member of the companys Executive Committee whose roughly 50 members are listed in JPMorgans annual report and who meet quarterly Lake has had some experience in the last five years meeting with Wall Street securities analysts whom she will address in future quarterly conference calls after earnings reports In her previous roles she saw the financial crisis up close as JPMorgan acquired investment bank Bear Stearns and then as the US housing crisis battered JPMorgans mortgage investments From 200709 she worked in JPMorgans investment bank as global controller in finance and business management Lake first met Dimon when he came to the bank in 2004 Dimon in the companys statement said Lake has developed an impressive breadth of knowledge and experience in finance across both our wholesale and our consumer businesses Lake a chartered accountant managed global finance infrastructure and control functions in JPMorgans corporate finance group from 2004 to 2007 Before that she was a senior financial officer for the company in the United Kingdom She also worked for PriceWaterhouseCoopers in London and Sydney before joining JPMorgan Lake is a citizen of both the United States and the United Kingdom having been born to an American mother and a British father MANAGEMENT RESHUFFLES Dimon took Braunstein out of his line of direct reports in July assigning him to answer first to Matt Zames a top mortgage markets executive whom he had just named cochief operating officer of the company Dimon in testimony before a congressional committee in Washington in June cited Braunstein as being among top lieutenants whom he had relied upon to check the London Whale reports Others he cited were company risk officers In October former Chief Risk Officer Barry Zubrow said that he would retire at the end of the year Another person whom Dimon cited was Ina Drew who was head of the Chief Investment Office and who left shortly after the losses surfaced Besides the shakeups this year Dimon shuffled some of his top executives at least once in each of the three previous years He has said that he likes to rotate his top staff through different positions as part of preparing potential successors In June 2011 Dimon replaced retail banking chief Charlie Scharf who has since become CEO of Visa Inc  VN  In June 2010 Dimon named Braunstein to be CFO after Cavanagh had held the post for six years Cavanagh was then put in charge of JPMorgans Treasury  Securities Services unit which handles payments and other transactions for corporations and governments Cavanaghs assignment changed somewhat in this years July shuffle when Dimon said the bank would combine the treasury services business with its investment bank and that Cavanagh would become cohead of the new unit with Pinto In 2009 Dimon named Jes Staley to take over the investment bank replacing its cochief executives Bill Winters and Steve Black At the time it look like Staley could become a successor to Dimon though they are about the same age But in July of this year Staley was moved out of that executive role to become chairman of the combined corporate and investment

12/08/2010,HP alleges Autonomy wrongdoing takes $8.8 billion charge, Reuters  HewlettPackard stunned Wall Street by alleging a massive accounting scandal at its British software unit Autonomy that will cost the company the majority of 88 billion in charges   It was the latest in a string of reversals that have renewed questions about the basic competence of the storied companys board and senior managers HP said on Tuesday it discovered serious accounting improprieties and a willful effort by Autonomy to mislead shareholders after a whistleblower came forward following the ouster of Autonomys thenchief executive Mike Lynch in May The charge follows a nearly 11 billion writedown last quarter for the companys EDS services division The technology company has been roiled in the past few years by a revolving door of CEOs overall management turnover and challenges in its core personal computer and printer businesses HPs stock slid to a 10year low dropping 12 percent to 1171 in regular trading on Tuesday Shares are down nearly 50 percent year to date Lynch flatly rejected HPs allegations and said he was shocked but confident he would be absolved of any wrongdoing He had not been notified by HP about the allegation before it was made public nor had he been contacted by any authorities Lynch said in an interview with Reuters HP took 88 billion in charges in the quarter with 5 billion tied to the problems at Autonomy The rest of the charge related to the recent trading value of HP stock and headwinds against anticipated synergies and marketplace performance HP said HP said it has referred the matter to the US Securities and Exchange Commissions enforcement division and the UKs Serious Fraud Office for civil and criminal investigation It said it would take legal action to recoup what we can for our shareholders Both agencies declined to comment HP Chief Executive Meg Whitman who voted for the deal while she was on HPs board said the investigation of Autonomys finances  both external and internal  will take multiple years as it makes it way through the courts in both countries Most of the board was here and voted for this deal and we feel terribly about that said Whitman on a call with analysts The board relied on audited financials audited by Deloitte Not Brand X accounting firm but Deloitte she said adding that KPMG was hired to audit Deloitte Neither of them saw what we now see after someone came forward to point us in the right direction Whitman said INFLATED SALES REVENUE HP alleged that Autonomys former management inflated revenue and gross margins to mislead potential buyers It said Autonomy executives mischaracterized revenue from lowend hardware sales as software sales and booked some licensing deals with partners as revenue even though no customer bought products HP said Autonomy claimed its gross margins were in the 40 percent to 45 percent range while realistically they were in the 28 percent to 30 percent range Moreover Autonomy always represented itself as a software firm but 10 percent to 15 percent of its revenue came from moneylosing sales of lowend hardware HP said The company also claimed that Autonomy was booking licensing revenue upfront before deals closed HP has embarked on an internal investigation including a forensic review by PricewaterhouseCoopers of Autonomys historical financial results under HP General Counsel John Schultz after the whistleblower came forward in May Schultz said since the accounting troubles occurred prior to the acquisition of Autonomy it took a long time before HP was in a position to make the news public Not surprisingly Autonomy did not have sitting on a shelf somewhere a set of wellmaintained books that would walk you through what was actually happening from a financial perspective inside the company he said Indeed critical documents were missing from the obvious places and it required that we look in every nook and cranny Whitman said her predecessor Leo Apotheker and the former chief strategy officer Shane Robison were the key people behind the Autonomy acquisition Apotheker bought Autonomy to diversify HPs business and beef up its portfolio to provide onestop shopping for corporations The 11 billion acquisition of Autonomy  heavily criticized by investors as too costly  was a key part of the plan to transform HP Apotheker was ousted as CEO in September 2011 after just 11 months on the job and Robison left soon after In a statement Apotheker said he was stunned and disappointed by the revelations and offered to make himself available to HP and the authorities to get to the bottom of the matter Whitman on Tuesday stood by Autonomys technology and products despite the allegations saying it will be the growth engine for HP The former California gubernatorial candidate has been trying to move beyond some of HPs past controversies which includes the ouster of the past two CEOs a haphazard product strategy and a plan to sell its PC unit that was later dropped HP has been running Autonomy since the acquisition closed in October 2011 but it didnt find the accounting problems on its own The company investigated only after a senior Autonomy executive came forward to detail the financial metrics surrounding Autonomy Advisers working on behalf of Autonomy included Qatalyst Partners the investment bank run by technology investment banker Frank Quattrone UBS Goldman Sachs Citigroup JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Perella Weinberg Partners and Barclays Capital advised for HP Law firms for Autonomy were Slaughter  May and Morgan Lewis The firms for HP included Gibson Dunn  Crutcher Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer Drinker Biddle  Reath and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher  Flom Robert Enderle a tech analyst at the Enderle Group said he has never seen such a potential misrepresentation of financials You have to rely on what the firm gives you during due diligence and Ive never seen a misstatement at this level Enderle said If the charges are true it could result in a massive punitive damages award for HP Enderle said Other analysts hoped it was the end of the bad news for HP This kind of feels like the last of the bad news Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said FOURTHQUARTER LOSS The Autonomy allegations and announcement of the charge coincided with the reporting of a fiscal fourthquarter loss for HP HP said net revenue fell 67 percent to 2996 billion for the quarter ended October 31 from 3212 billion a year earlier Analysts on average expected 3043 billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES Revenue from all of its main business units declined with the personal computer division recording the steepest drop at 14 percent while revenue from printing fell 5 percent HP reported a quarterly net loss of 685 billion or 349 a share versus a profit of 239 million or 12 cents a year earlier The sprawling company which employs more than 300000 people globally is undergoing a restructuring aimed at focusing on

12/06/2010,Egypt agrees deal for $4.8 billion IMF loan, CAIRO  Reuters  Egypt reached a preliminary agreement on Tuesday with the International Monetary Fund for a 48 billion loan a step seen as vital to shoring up the nations finances   Investors who abandoned Egypt during the political turmoil that followed the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak last year have been looking to the IMF to give its seal of approval to the governments economic program Egypts benchmark index  EGX30  pared losses on the news and the cost of insuring Egyptian debt against default fell We have a preliminary agreement with the technical team of the IMF Planning and International Cooperation Minister Ashraf alAraby told a news conference with the head of the IMF delegation Andreas Bauer and other Fund officials Egypt said the deal included agreement to rein in Egypts budget deficit with measures including tax changes targeting the wealthy and more careful spending on subsidies intended to help the poor The deficit goal is 85 percent of gross domestic product GDP in fiscal 201314 from 11 percent in the financial year that ended June 2012 However the 25 percent top rate for income and corporate tax would not change the cabinet said in a statement issued after the deal was announced The government has repeatedly said its program would protect the poor many of whom rely heavily on subsidized food and other essentials The uprising that ousted Mubarak was driven as much by demands for social justice as it was by calls for political freedom With a rapidly growing population Egypt needs economic growth to revive to the pace of 6 percent or more that it was achieving in the years before Mubaraks overthrow in order to ease widespread unemployment among the young Growth slipped to just over 2 percent in the year to June 30 A recovery has been complicated by weak export and tourism markets and fear among potential investors of a sharp drop in the Egyptian pound currency that could wipe out their returns Even though the preliminary agreement is nonbinding it still sends a signal to investors that we are on the right track said Youssef Kamel an analyst at Egypts Rasmala The agreement would go to the IMF board to be finalized on December 19 with the first tranche of the loan to be released immediately the board approved the deal IMF officials said I expect that the board will agree on the deal Abdel Shakour Shalaan Middle East representative on the IMF board told the news conference The EGX30 stocks index recovered from about 16 percent down before the IMF deal was announced to close the session hardly changed Egypts fiveyear credit default swaps fell 25 basis points from Mondays close to 400 bps according to Markit AID FLOWS As well as boosting investor confidence the IMF deal is expected to trigger more aid and concessionary finance The authorities program will be supported by a financing package of 145 billion in loans and deposits on favorable terms from a range of bilateral and multilateral partners including the IMF the Funds Bauer said in a statement He did not give a breakdown but Qatar and Saudi Arabia have already provided support and pledged more The European Union and the United States have also pledged funds The authorities plan to reduce wasteful expenditures including by reforming energy subsidies and better targeting them to vulnerable groups At the same time the authorities intend to raise revenues through tax reforms Bauer added The Fund said the loan carried an interest rate of 106 percent and that there were fees attached The IMF standby agreement would last 22 months Although officials would not give a value for the first tranche of the IMF loan the state news agency cited an unnamed Egyptian ministry official saying it was expected to be around 15 billion to 2 billion We are happy that the IMF is supporting our program at this stage Araby said adding the economic program would achieve social justice and targets those on limited incomes As well as cutting the budget deficit the cabinet said it would cut state debt to about 70 pct of GDP in 201617 On corporate tax the cabinet said all companies would pay tax at 25 percent instead of the current split level system where the ceiling was 25 percent A system of valueadded tax would replace the existing sales tax in 2014 the cabinet said On income tax Prime Minister Hisham Kandil told Reuters on Monday that a new rate would be inserted between the 20 and 25 percent bands that affect the highest earners He did not say at what salary level any new rate would kick in The government has already outlined measures to cut back on fuel subsidies one of the biggest drains on state finances They include ensuring subsidized cooking gas cylinders are targeted more effectively to reach the needy ending subsidies on 95octane gasoline the highest grade available in Egypt and plans to issue fuel smart cards that will limit the amount of subsidized gasoline drivers

11/19/2010,Analysis: Logitech caught in accessories mousetrap, ZURICH  Reuters  As retailers stock up for Christmas the No 1 maker of computer mice is fighting to increase its share of the computer accessories market in an increasingly mouseless world   Founded in a farmhouse near the small Swiss town of RomanelsurMorges in 1981 Logitechs  LOGNS   LOGIO  star rose rapidly in the 1980s when it marketed the first modern computer mouse developed at the nearby Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne Since then the SwissAmerican company has shipped more than a billion mice and introduced a successful lineup of PC accessories including keyboards cameras and speakers But like many other household names in the industry including Intel  INTCO  Hewlett Packard  HPQN  and IBM  IBMN  Logitech is having trouble adapting to a market increasingly dominated by the tablets and smartphones that make much of its product line redundant There is no doubt that the industry of classic computers which is a big part of our business is changing Logitechs president Bracken Darrell told Reuters speaking from the companys US headquarters in Newark California After a dismal 201112 financial year when Logitech issued backtoback profit warnings and sacked its top management the company promised investors a range of explosive new products The revamped lineup of audio products for both smartphones and tablets  including headphones speakers a WiFiconnected smart radio and a boombox  ultimately failed to grip the imagination leaving many investors wondering about the companys future growth prospects Logitechs share price remains nailed below seven Swiss francs against its historic high of 4152 francs back in 2007 prior to Apples  AAPLO  launch of the first generation iPhone and back when it was seen as the Apple of computer accessories The products recently launched are solid but no real game changers said Credit Suisse technology analyst Chris Gretler FRESH KNOCK The groups shares took a fresh knock on October 25 plunging more than 16 percent when the company released a dismal set of second quarter numbers reflecting sliding PC sales According to data from market research firm IDC global PC shipments fell another 86 percent in the third quarter Yearonyear sales have been down in each of the companys past four quarters Twothirds of Logitechs business still depends on PC sales while customers spend an everincreasing part of their budget on mobile computing said Andreas Mueller technology analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank ZKB Although Logitech is catering increasingly to mobile users the need for addons in this segment is much lower he said Semir Saleh 25 is a case in point A videodesigner from London who is in Zurich freelancing for Swiss internet companies Saleh said he had very little use for accessories The iPad comes with everything I need he said I use for instance Skype a lot The new one even comes with a camera so there is no need to buy one According to Reuters company data Logitech sales over the coming years are likely to stagnate at around 23 billion Swiss francs 249 billion TURNING THINGS AROUND Chief executive Darrell was brought in from home appliances giant Whirlpool  WHRN  to turn the troubled company around and will succeed current chief executive and chairman Guerrino De Luca in January next year He said although Logitech may have been slow to embrace new developments in the industry it was never too late to start No matter when we started I think its smart to be in it he said in the interview with Reuters One recent hit is Logitechs combination of keyboard and cover for the iPad which according to technology analysts contributes around five percent to the companys annual turnover The cover has been such a success that Apple allows Logitech to sell it via its Apple stores But technology analysts say that original equipment makers will be quick to exploit such niches themselves Microsofts new Surface tablet will come fully equipped with a keyboard for example ZKB analyst Mueller said The company is pinning high hopes on Microsofts new Windows 8 operating system which is geared towards mobile users and which Logitech expects to reanimate the moribund PC business But technology analysts say this will not necessarily boost sales of pointing devices such as computer mice as the trend is going more and more towards gesture and speech communication New multitouch systems currently under development at universities and research labs in the United States and elsewhere could soon allow users to operate computer by gestures transmitted via a camera and video projector Logitech is simply nonexistent in this field said Kepler Capital Markets technology analyst Cyrill Pluess meaning the company once again is running the risk of missing out on new mega trends Asked about the new technology Darrell said it was too early to tell how it would be applied in workspaces and homes I by no means think the mouse is dead Its alive and well and will be for a long time Logitech has some reason to be cautious The company had its fingers burnt leaping onto supposedly hot new technologies such as its access system for GoogleTV  GOOGO  which proved a costly flop after Logitech sank more than 100 million into it COSTCUTTING The company has announced a costcutting programme that includes plans to shed 450 jobs out of a total workforce of 3300 which analysts say is a good start toward a better business model I think they are on a good way to bring their cost base in line with their changed sales prospects ZKBs Mueller said Given its cash reserves of more than 360 million Swiss francs 38774 million Logitech should have some staying power but analysts think further cuts are unavoidable And though analysts predict that there will still be a market for accessories the future Logitech may look quite different from today We are learning and continuing to learn about risk management and taking bets What we cant do and what we wont do is stop making bets he said 1  09234 Swiss francs Additional reporting Tarmo Virki and Caroline Copley Editing by  Sonya Hepinstall

11/17/2010,Intel CEO to retire as chipmaker struggles with mobile, SAN FRANCISCONEW YORK  Reuters  Intel Corps Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini will retire sooner than expected and the top chipmaker said it may name an outsider for the position for the first time to steer a difficult transition toward mobile computing   Intel which has selected chief executives from within its own ranks throughout its 45year history said it would consider both internal and external candidates in a transition expected to last six months Otellini will retire in May at the age of 62 earlier than the companys mandatory retirement age for CEOs of 65 Intels fifth chief executive Otellini has worked at the company for nearly 40 years and became CEO in 2005 Intels board was surprised last week when Otellini announced he planned to retire and it tried to get Otellini to stay Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said Some Wall Street analysts said it might make sense for Intel to consider hiring an outsider to shake up its strategy as the computing world goes through its most significant shift since the advent of the Internet But internal candidates will have a leg up over potential outside contenders because of Intels size complexity and engineerdriven culture Mulloy said For any company of the size and complexity of Intel an internal candidate would have a natural advantage he said However Mulloy added Good corporate governance dictates today you should look inside and out Intel whose processors are dominant in personal computers has been slow to expand into the fastgrowing mobile industry where Apple Incs iPads and iPhones and other popular mobile devices use competing technology from Britains ARM Holdings Plc We all know that everyone is using smartphones and tablets now Its the era of Intel versus ARM so it may be good to come in with some fresh blood and a new perspective Evercore analyst Patrick Wang said Intel said it was promoting three executives to become executive vice presidents Renee James who is in charge of Intel software Brian Krzanich who is chief operating officer and oversees manufacturing and Stacy Smith chief financial officer and director of corporate strategy Smith wellknown by Wall Street and Krzanich have in the past been viewed as potential CEOs There is a comfort level with Stacy Smith said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree Krzanich a threedecade Intel veteran made a name for himself improving the efficiency of the chipmakers cuttingedge factories He was promoted to chief operating officer last March effectively throwing him in the running for the post of CEO Analysts said James focus on software instead of hardware made her less likely to be promoted to CEO Bryant pointed to Krzanich Smith and James as well as Intel Capital head Arvind Sodhani and Dadi Perlmutter head of Intels push into mobile as important executives for Intels future according to Barrons END OF AN ERA Since it was founded in 1968 Intel has promoted CEOs from within But the increasing belief that the PC era which Intel helped create may be drawing to a close could explain Intels willingness to look for outside candidates analysts said Previous CEO transitions have all involved carefully groomed internal candidates But if Intels board is now looking externally  to bring in new skills  that would explain the lack of a named successor and length of time in transition said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney Intels board may have trouble finding an outsider with the strategic vision to lead it into the mobile market as well as the chops to run the cuttingedge factories that give the chipmaker a technological lead over its competitors Since most other chipmakers have closed down their fabrication plants over the past two decades and outsourced production overseas few executives have experience planning and running plants that now cost upwards of 10 billion each to build Armed with a bachelors degree in economics and an MBA from the University of California Otellini began at Intel in 1974 when most of the companys sales came from memory chips and before it turned to PC processors He managed several business units before being appointed chief operating officer in 2002 TROUBLED WATERS With economic growth slowing in China and struggling in Europe and the United States global PC shipments are expected to decline slightly this year the first annual drop since 2001 The top chipmaker is currently running its factories at less than 50 percent of capacity redirecting unused space and equipment to be used for more cuttingedge production lines still being built The Santa Clara Californiabased company has long been king of the PC chip market particularly through its historic Wintel alliance with Microsoft Corp which led to breathtakingly high profit margins and an 80 percent market share But it has struggled to adapt its powerful PC processors for batterypowered smartphones and tablets Its market share for smartphones is less than 1 percent trailing Qualcomm Inc Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ARM Holdings Plc and others That leads some investors already concerned about a lackluster global economy to ask if Intels supremacy has come to an end and whether the companys potential for profit and revenue growth may be limited Intels shares closed up 03 percent at 2025 in Nasdaq trading on Monday Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Intels smaller rival in PC processors rose 322 percent to 192 Reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Liana B Baker in New York Editing by Lisa Von Ahn Maureen Bavdek

11/12/2010,Analysis: Investors make $100 billion bet on China's drive up value chain, BEIJING  Reuters  Chinas soaring wages and strengthening currency might blunt the competitive edge of exporters that have seen average pay double since 2007 but it wont stop firms worldwide making a collective 100 billion bet on setting up shop here this year   Although foreign direct investment inflows in 2012 have seen the longest monthly run of yearonyear declines since 2009 hurt by a weak outlook for corporate investment and sagging global trade FDI should still top 100 billion for the third year running That would bring Chinas total since 2007 to about 625 billion based on data from United Nations agency UNCTAD during which time a rally in the yuan currency has sliced 25 percent from exporters margins Vietnam Bangladesh Indonesia and Thailand combined managed to snag only 1416 billion in FDI between them from 2007 to 2011 despite being repeatedly touted as the places to which manufacturers fleeing China flock What keeps the money coming to China is a steady shift away from cheap assembly lines to high valueadded production and from volatile external demand to the spending power of a new mainstream consumer class that analysts at McKinsey reckon will rise 10fold between 2010 and 2020 Indeed the decline of lowend manufacturing fits with Beijings ambition to drive firms up the global value chain to help sustain the wage rises vital to attaining developed economy status and avoiding a middle income trap of low wages and stagnating growth Its so far not threatening to the competitiveness position of China because its the very lowend of manufacturing sectors that are affected Louis Kuijs chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong told Reuters In that sense its quite consistent with the governments strategy to move up the value chain and improve the industrial structure said Kuijs a former World Bank economist in China Under government guidance on foreign investment issued in December 2011 China aims to lure more FDI in advanced manufacturing as well as services including logistics research and development higher education and vocational

directlyowned factory in China but it still sources goods from local suppliers Supply chains and relatively sound infrastructure make China a standout destination for many foreign investors A lot of our suppliers are in the immediate neighborhood which cuts logistics and other costs said Park Jong Ho management director at LG Innotek in Yantai in the eastern Shandong province If it were just a question of labor costs we should go to Southeast Asia The reason to be here is not labor costs Currently minimum wages in China range from 870 yuan 139 per month to 1500 yuan according to government data In Vietnam the minimum wage is around 105 million dong 50 Chinas foreign direct investment inflows fell 345 percent in the first 10 months of 2012 from a year ago compared with an annual average 92 percent rise between 2002 and 2011 that saw investors plough in a cumulative 12 trillion That cash has now got to work smarter economists say Chinas manufacturing sector is suffering from overcapacity and investment opportunities will be limited said Minggao Shen China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong If we assume Chinas economy can continue to grow around 68 percent in the next decade Chinas market is still attractive But we will see a structural change  more on services sector consumption more on industrial upgrading STRUCTURAL SHIFT That shift is already happening according to official data that shows foreign investment accounted for just over 50 percent of Chinas total exports in the first nine months of 2012 down from 57 percent in 2007 Meanwhile the proportion of FDI inflows into Chinas services sector were 437 billion in the first 10 months of 2012 versus the 404 billion that went into manufacturing FDI into services beat manufacturing FDI for the first time in 2011 Chinas services sector makes up far less than the 6070 percent of GDP typical in major developed economies but its 433 percent share in 2011 is not far behind the manufacturing sectors 466 percent share according to World Bank data Beijing aims to boost the services sectors relative share of GDP to 47 percent by 2015 Under the banner of industrial transfers endorsed by Beijing provincial officials in the interior have rolled out the red carpet for foreign firms trying to escape higher costs in the more developed coastal areas Zhang Xiaodong the communist party chief of Anyang city in central Henan province said the industrial city was luring more outside investment including that from big stateowned firms and private firms due to its lower wages and land costs But the cost for industrial transfers is rising as labor resources land and capital become key constraints he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Communist Party congress Foxconn Technology Group the worlds largest contract electronics maker has moved its main operations to such inland provinces as Henan and Shanxi Its factory in Shanxi alone employs nearly 80000 people In the first 10 months of 2012 FDI into Chinas six central provinces  Henan Hunan Hubei Auhui Jiangxi and Shanxi  jumped 194 percent from a year ago to 78 billion or 85 percent of the total according to official data FDI into eastern provinces including Guangdong Jiangsu Zhejiang and Shandong fell 61 percent to 768 billion But they got the lions share 84 percent of FDI suggesting foreign firms still favor established locations Both trends are happening at the same time said Yao Wei chief China economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong It does seem that companies are weighing the pros and cons But if everyone does look at China as a potential consumer market it does make sense to first move the inland Additional reporting by  Lucy Hornby  Editing by  Nick Edwards  and  Alex Richardson

11/10/2010,Pitfalls lurk as Fed marches toward transparency, NEW YORK  Reuters  Federal Reserve officials want to tell the world what would cause them finally to reverse four years of easy US monetary policy but something is keeping them up at night   In the central banks nightmare scenario anxious investors drive up Treasury yields and abandon stocks as the nations unemployment rate edges toward a level officials had flagged as a goal effectively tightening financial conditions and undermining monetary policy before the Fed was ready to act The worry is that such a situation could trip up the slow recovery from the Great Recession just when the US economy finally gains pace The Fed is carefully plotting how to avoid this communications nightmare These worries are slowing progress toward an agreement among the Feds 19 policymakers on socalled thresholds  economic data points like specific unemployment and inflation rates  that would signal when the central bank is likely to begin raising benchmark interest rates from near zero Many of the officials want to adopt them and influential Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen voiced her strong support last week making the project sound all but inevitable In his most detailed public comments on the growing debate Bernanke on Tuesday called the thresholds a very promising direction for policy because it would help markets predict future Fed decisions But it would be a challenge to summarize into two or three numbers the conditions necessary for the Fed to tighten policy he cautioned Such a rule would probably hinge on several pieces of economic information such as the number of Americans hunting for work If adopted the rule would be the latest step toward Bernankes goal of a more transparent central bank But the trick is getting a hairtrigger market to behave Although the Feds aim would be to inform the market how long its ultraeasy policies will stand that could backfire if investors interpret the conditional thresholds as automatic triggers or if they try to frontrun tighter policies Aggressive traders are all for the Fed going in that direction because it will put money in their pocket said Brian Reynolds chief market strategist at New York brokerage Rosenblatt Securities If you give them some concrete rules laid out in advance the hedge funds will beat the Fed to the punch he said To be sure investors have long tried to predict changes to monetary policy Indeed markets need to react for those policies to work effectively But as the Fed tests new ways to explain its unprecedented easing it might court trouble if communications rules are too precise Fed officials are well aware of this threat setting the stage for a delicate few months of trying to persuade investors that whatever rule they adopt is credible and helpful but not set in stone They could also abandon the idea altogether PROCEED WITH CAUTION Thresholds would replace a pledge the central bank has made to keep rates low until mid2015 Many Fed officials and outside economists do not like this calendar date because it seems rigid or farfetched and can be misinterpreted as a promise Hinting at the challenges ahead Yellen who chairs a Fed subcommittee on communications and is a frontrunner to succeed Bernanke in 2014 stressed last week that the thresholds would not trigger a rate hike She also said that decision would require further deliberation by policymakers But not everyone is convinced the message will get through Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser who sits on Yellens subcommittee said thresholds could be misinterpreted as longerrun policy goals I am concerned that we would create more confusion than clarity he said on Thursday Plosser voiced similar concerns back in January when the Feds latest change in communications confused some investors Emerging from a policysetting meeting the Fed announced it intended to keep rates low until late 2014 and then hours later published for the first time charts showing that more than a third of its policymakers expected a rate rise before 2014 The contradicting messages whiplashed bond markets and may have instilled some extra caution in the central bank as it looks forward to yet new ways to refine communications EXPECTATIONS GAME US unemployment was lofty at 79 percent last month while inflation has remained a bit below the Feds 2 percent target Many factors from wages to demographics to government spending are behind the unemployment rate The inflation rate is similarly noisy which poses problems if the thresholds are interpreted as blunt tools For example the Fed is not likely to be satisfied with a jobless rate that is dropping because Americans are leaving the workforce en masse as has sometimes been the case over the last 18 months But these important nuances may not matter to investors who anticipate the Fed will keep its word and move to raise shortterm interest rates when the threshold nears The market will start pricing in a lot of hikes then the yield curve will steepen quite a bit and equities will tank and a lot of the good things that had momentum going into that move could become undone predicted Krishna Kumar a partner at New York hedge fund Goose Hollow Alpha Advisors It becomes an expectations game he added At the last few Fed meetings talk of thresholds has heated up Last month officials weighed the merits of adopting quantitative thresholds versus a more qualitative description of what informs its thinking according to the Feds minutes In the end a number of practical issues were left unresolved and Bernanke told staff to do more work on the proposal The careful internal deliberations have not stopped some central bank policymakers from taking their ideas on the road Last year Chicago Fed President Charles Evans pitched thresholds of 7 percent unemployment and no more than 3 percent inflation In the last few months two other regional Fed presidents floated their own plans Bernanke is set to hold a press conference after the Feds December 1112 policy meeting but that might be too early for any final decision We are probably still a couple of months away from such a communication strategy said Michael Feroli chief US economist at JPMorgan In the meantime he said the Fed will probably continue educating the market on how to interpret the thresholds Reporting by Jonathan Spicer

index futures worth a staggering 875 billion After UBS frantically unwound the positions the thirdbiggest rogue trading scandal in history had lost it 23 billion I will expect that questions will be asked as to why nobody was aware of these trades Adoboli wrote in the email I take responsibility for my actions and the shitstorm that will now ensue I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for

traders at a bank where bosses encouraged rulebending in pursuit of profits and colleagues and line managers knew what he was doing For eight grueling days in the witness box he was confident and articulate It was easy to see why in happier times UBS picked him for their Ascent program for future leaders He was also passionate UBS was my family and every single thing I did every single bit of effort I put into that organization was for the benefit of the bank I was so proud to work for he said on the first morning sobbing and thumping the box Such was his commitment he said he had slept under his desk on several occasions and even missed his grandmothers funeral Managers pushed him to take big risks he said railing at the machine that singled him out for blame when all he had done

made huge losses on billions of dollars of secret trades despite official risk limits of 100 million intraday and 50 million overnight He flipped from a short to a long position on July 1 but it went badly wrong as markets fell on worries about the euro zone and the US debt ceiling crisis CAUGHT WITH HIS PANTS DOWN The concealed risk exposure from his trades had risen from 15 billion on June 30 to a peak of 12 billion on August 8 He said he was buying the dip in the hope of a market bounce under advice from colleague John Hughes and burnout had desensitized him to the numbers He admitted his bookkeeping became messy hence a growing number of queries from the likes of Steward in the back office and he lied to buy time to recoup the losses But the big market move he needed never happened On September 14 an increasingly anxious Steward asked Adoboli for the names of the counterparties to some of the problem trades There were no counterparties He was about to be caught with his pants down prosecutor Wass said He left the office and sent the bombshell email to Steward copying in his boss John DiBacco He was called back in arriving at 345 pm for meetings with managers and later lawyers until the police were called after midnight At 335 am he was arrested He spent nine months in Wandsworth Prison until granted bail in June 2012 On the anniversary of the notorious email Wass opened the prosecutions case painting Adoboli as a gambling addict on a losing streak who kept increasing his bets in the desperate hope his number would come up Despite an annual salary of 110000 pounds 175000 and a last bonus worth 250000 pounds in cash and shares he was broke He lost 123000 pounds on spreadbetting in the year before his arrest and took shortterm loans from firms like Wongacom and Moneybox You were not able to live on your enormous salary because you could not stop yourself from gambling Wass said Spreadbetting Adoboli countered was common among City traders like a taxi driver driving his own taxi home Though found guilty of fraud the jury was to find him not guilty of the four false accounting charges for which they needed to be certain he acted for personal financial gain SLUSH ACCOUNT The defense team produced transcripts of electronic chats between Adoboli and others at UBS that they said showed he was open about his methods and no questions were asked while he made profits Have you used the slush account asked a trader from another desk Darren Bailey on March 23 2011 The defense said this was a reference to Adobolis umbrella an accounting trick he had developed since 2008 to build up a hidden profit pool to smooth out fluctuations Adoboli said Bailey was among many traders with such systems though Bailey said he was genuinely shocked by the slush account chat and did not remember what it was about Several backoffice staff were also confronted with chats the defense said showed they knew about Adobolis methods On April 26 2011 Adoboli told backoffice contractor Johannes Zuidmeer he had made a cosmetic adjustment to a booking Zuidmeer did not question this On August 11 Zuidmeer let Adoboli hold back 1 billion in losses so he could rectify a booking error With the benefit of hindsight it looks serious Zuidmeer said but he denied knowingly aiding Adoboli Wass said the chats were meaningless vague and ambiguous and spun to support a defense cooked up after Adobolis arrest UMBRELLAS GOING TO GET US BOTH FIRED The defenses main target was Hughes the other senior trader on the ETF desk who was sacked after Adobolis arrest for failing to adequately supervise him For three days Hughes was confronted with dozens of chats that showed he embraced the concept of the umbrella All I can say is thank fuck for your umbrella Hughes told Adoboli in January 2011 when the desk had made losses But Wass said another chat from March showed Hughes may have gone along with it but he knew it was wrong Your umbrellas going to get us both fired it read Hughes mumbled and fiddled with his long blond hair as lawyers struggled to get clear answers The son of a builder he said he went into trading to make money and pay his debts He didnt take the job too seriously leaving every day at 5pm He ignored 17 requests from the compliance department to complete training in supervisory duties Adoboli said all four of the desk traders including Hughes met at a bar on the evening of September 12 to decide who was going to carry the can for the losses When the meeting ended he lamented in a text to his girlfriend that the boys have sold me down the river UBS office records show all four left the office together and returned an hour later that evening but the three said they had no memory of such a meeting On September 14 when Adoboli texted his girlfriend during his long night confessing to management he told her Theres a problem with my story that I acted on my own It just doesnt hold water His girlfriend texted back that he should not tell any further lies to protect others Evidence showed Hughes booked several fictitious trades of his own in June and July 2011 using the same method Acceptance of the umbrella by the shambolic and irresponsible Hughes said Wass could not be presented as approval by UBS management KERVIELS FOOTSTEPS Adobolis most recent line managers also took the stand Ron Greenidge who supervised the desk until April 2011 was sacked for failing to properly supervise Adoboli but he defended the bank denying that management encouraged dubious practices DiBacco who took over supervision from Greenidge and was also sacked dismissed suggestions that he encouraged traders to ignore rules as crap The defense presented a June 23 email in which Adoboli told DiBacco the trading position that day hit 200 million making 6 million profit Thanks for the update Well done DiBacco replied Seconds later he sent another email When over 100 million and certainly 200 million I need to know before not after  If the PnL profit and loss had gone the other way I dont want a lot of crap coming down on you alone Adoboli said the first email showed management didnt care about risk limits and the second was a backcovering exercise DiBacco angrily denied it One question that arose repeatedly was why Adoboli acted as he did when the case of Jerome Kerviel a trader who lost 7 billion at French bank Societe Generale was so fresh Adoboli said he and Kerviel were in trouble for one reason only losing money the only unforgivable crime in banking To think that he does exactly what Hughesy and I do Adoboli mused in an email to friend Sarah Moore in 2008 after the Kerviel story broke Please dont let me read about you in the papers in the same fashion Moore responded 1  06302 British pounds This article

10/19/2010,France to answer ratings downgrade with reforms, PARIS  Reuters  France said on Tuesday it would respond to a Moodys credit downgrade by pushing on with reforms complaining that the ratings agency had overlooked steps already taken to revamp the euro zones secondlargest economy   France lost its prized tripleA badge from the Standard  Poors agency in January so Mondays move by Moodys was not surprising But it underlined doubts about Socialist President Francois Hollandes ability to fix Frances public finances The downgrade also highlighted the divergence with the toprated regional powerhouse Germany whose finance minister called it a small warning to its most important euro zone partner Hollande said after the cut We must take note stick to our economic policies keep on track and understand that we have every interest in improving public finances Moodys said it would assess the tripleA ratings of the euro zones EFSF and ESM bailout funds in light of its onenotch cut of France to Aa1 with a negative outlook However its France downgrade did not appear to affect the perceived status of French bonds which along with German debt are seen as a safe haven from the crisis in southern Europe The benchmark French 10year government bond yield  which has been trading at historic lows and offering Hollande crucial access to cheap borrowing  was little changed at 215 percent versus 208 percent before the downgrade Moodys raised concerns about Frances capacity to reform and so it is up to us to show that this time we are going to carry out reforms Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici leading a government offensive to play down the move told journalists The rating change does not call into question either the economic fundamentals of our country the efforts undertaken by the government or our creditworthiness The government is planning the toughest belttightening effort in 30 years in 2013 but must also try and halt a growth slowdown that has seen unemployment surge to 13year highs Moodys said it kept a negative outlook on France due to structural challenges and a sustained loss of competitiveness in the country where business leaders blame high labor charges for dragging down exports It also cited sizable exposures of its banks to weak southern euro zone countries The first driver  is the risk to economic growth and therefore to the governments finances posed by the countrys persistent structural economic challenges Moodys said The downgrade initially nudged the euro 030 percent lower to 12770 against the dollar late on Monday but the currency recovered some ground to trade at 12805 at 1730 GMT on Tuesday Deutsche Bank economist Gilles Moec said the fact the downgrade was largely priced in did not take the pressure off Hollande to show he will pursue more reforms with an overhaul of rigid hiring and firing rules seen as the most pressing Public opinion in France  as well as the market ultimately  will expect a reaction from the executive Moec said The market  is giving France the benefit of the doubt but a further clarification of the policy stance is becoming urgent NEGATIVE OUTLOOK Moodys said it could cut France again if efforts to free up the rigid labor market and overhaul an economy where public spending accounts for 57 percent of output ran into trouble We would downgrade the rating further in the event of an additional material deterioration in Frances economic prospects or in a scenario in which there were difficulties in implementing the announced reforms Moodys lead France analyst Dietmar Hornung told Reuters He said more big shocks from the euro zone debt crisis would also exert downward pressure on the rating The downgrade follows concerns raised by the IMF that France could be left behind as Italy and Spain reform at a faster pace The government has sent positive signals on public finance commitments and competitiveness However more is required said Societe Generales Michel Martinez who like many analysts sees French growth falling short of 2013 budget estimates But analysts see French bonds remaining resilient for now The French debt market is highly liquid and remains a favored venue for international investors particularly in a world where doubleA is becoming the norm among Western states Barclays France director Franklin Pichard said Yet with Germany one of the few major economies to retain a tripleA rating the move is likely to reinforce Berlins role as the capital calling the shots in the 17country euro zone Michael GrosseBroemer parliamentary whip of German Chancellor Angela Merkels ruling CDU party told Reuters the downgrade gave fresh impulse to France to fulfill its reforms Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the move was a warning for everyone in Europe to meet their responsibilities With Frances 2trillioneuro economy teetering on the brink of recession Hollande surprised many this month by granting 20 billion euros in annual tax relief to companies equivalent to a 6 percent cut in labor costs to spur competitiveness The government also plans 30 billion euros in budget savings next year to trim its deficit and has promised reforms next year to add flexibility to rigid labor laws Certain criticisms are too strong or are too late I would have preferred that the bold and unprecedented decisions on the crisis were better received Moscovici said of Moodys He said it was unfair to flag concerns over French banks as they have cut exposure to troubled euro states such as Greece I dont expect the downgrade to have an immediate knockon impact today on access to and cost of funding said Espirito Santo analyst Andrew Lim of any impact on the banking sector But he said Frances exposure to Spain Italy and peripheral Europe should be kept in mind As far as government borrowing goes France has completed its issuance for 2012 Demand is strong from foreign buyers who hold 55 percent of its longterm bonds but the downgrade could be a trigger to bet on yields rising next year Our view is the market is teeing itself up to short France in 2013 Its the trade everyone wants to get into said Lyn GrahamTaylor at Rabobank in London Additional reporting by

countries such as China and carmaking competitor South Korea have done Bucking an overall trend of falling productivity the central states already have a similar manufacturing output to the four border states of Baja California Coahuila Chihuahua and Tamaulipas with about onethird of the workforce On Guanajuatos Federal Highway 45 heavily traveled by trucks heading north to the US border a gleaming new factory stands where corn and beans used to grow German carmaker Volkswagen  VOWGpDE  will employ 700 skilled workers and produce 330000 engines a year at its 550 million plant joining foreign companies such as Japans Nissan  7201T  Honda  7267T  and Mazda  7261T  which are also building new factories on Mexicos fertile central plains The new operations drawn to the region by cheap wages and living costs abundant land good highways and incentives from local governments are helping to transform an area once known as the nations breadbasket into a hive of factory activity We are having a real boom here now with the automotive industry said Vanessa Cordero commercial director of the Castro del Rio industrial park which was built on a former asparagus farm some 20 minutes drive from the new VW plant Japanese carmakers tell all their suppliers to set up in Guanajuato by suchandsuch a date Thats why we have a tsunami of Japanese companies arriving in the state Volkswagen occupies 70 hectares of the 1000hectare industrial park Puerto Interior flanked by cornfields on one side and a new airport on the other The site also houses a new Pirelli  PECIMI  plant mainly making tires for the US market Were not looking for clients they come to us said Oswaldo Antillon logistics manager at Puerto Interior where onsite facilities include a customs house healthcare center two electricity substations three wells a polytechnic with 2000 students and a railway station Although the average murder rate in the central states was high at 16 murders per 100000 people in 2012 compared to one in China and 26 in South Korea it is half that of the four border states Executives from aerospace giant Bombardier  BBDbTO  say they have had no security problems at their glistening white plant in Queretaro where the Canadian company is building roughly 85 percent of the composite skeleton for the Learjet 85 From a strategic point of view Mexico is a very important operation said Bombardier plant quality manager Norman Thompson Bombardier can truck the parts made in Queretaro to Wichita Kansas for final assembly in two days and the roads are well policed he said EDUCATION PAYS In years past many young people in the region could only aspire to a minimum wage job earning 60 pesos 487 per day Now factories needing skilled workers have spawned specialized training centers like Queretaros aerospace university and Puerto Interiors National Polytechnical Institute campus The polytech helped establish a senior high school to bridge the gap between local secondary schooling and the rigors of an engineering degree Students 95 percent from nearby towns then spend five years at the polytech where tuition is free Before most of the local population did not even have a mediumlevel education only primary school and they worked in agriculture or migrated to the US said campus director Aldelmo Emmanuel Reyes He says a new engineering graduate can earn five times the minimum wage rising to 10 to 20 times more after five years Sergio Hernandez 20 is about to finish a twoyear program blending senior high school with onthejobtraining at auto part maker Schaeffler to become a production line supervisor Before that he worked for two years at a machinery workshop after secondary school He says his employment chances have improved incredibly since he started the course I have work experience that can be documented and my high school diploma MADE IN MEXICO New auto plants under construction including an Audi plant in nearby Puebla will employ more than 13000 people Officials say five times more jobs will be created down the track as factories source parts from Mexicanbased suppliers such as Honeywell International  HONN  which hired 10 percent to 15 percent more staff at its Mexicali plant after winning a turbocharger contract for VW Auto parts makers such as Japans Jatco and Germanys Hella are also setting up shop and manufacturing services provider North American Product Sharing expects up to 200 auto suppliers to flock to the region in the next three years With the Made in Mexico component in valueadded exports currently less than 70 percent experts say more local content is essential to a permanent break with the reassembly model Its very very important for Mexico to make that shift said veteran investor Mark Mobius who oversees 51 billion in emerging market assets at investment manager Franklin Templeton and is looking to increase investment in the country You could add another one or two percentage points to annual economic growth because increasing productivity and a move to higher valueadded means higher exports more income and higher foreign reserves The new auto plants should boost vehicle production by almost a quarter by 2017 when IHS Global Insight predicts Mexico will become the top US light vehicle importer In the last three years manufacturing jobs in the four central states have risen 30 percent and the region posted faster growth than Mexico as a whole between 2009 and 2011 Although transport especially autos is the main industry LOreal opened its biggest ever hair color factory in San Luis Potosi in December employing 400 people and Beiersdorf is investing 130 million in Silao to make Nivea and Labello products like body lotion lip balm and shower gel The worlds largest yogurt maker Danone  DANOPA  is extending its facilities in Irapuato near Silao where new villas overlook an 18hole golf course GROWING PAINS But the central region faces growing pains as the flood of new operations puts pressure on labor supply and infrastructure and states will need to lift investment to support big new factories as well as the housing and services needed by workers Investment banker Carlos Sales whose Cuasar Capital helped Aguascalientes secure 55 million to build extra gas pipelines and highway connections for a Nissan plant to open in late 2013 said investment would be easily recouped in extra tax revenue But more needs to be done Australian investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd  MQGAX  which specializes in infrastructure said Mexico needed to accelerate plans to bring in gas from the United States and replace expensive inefficient and dirty oilfired electricity production Mexico has to put in place the right structural parameters to let private investors come in and invest in those pipelines and make sure there is enough gas there to generate electricity and for industry that wants gas directly said Mark Ramsey head of Latin America for Macquarie Capital Theres not enough electricity generated for the growth thats expected 1  1220 Mexican pesos Additional reporting by  Alexandra Alper  Gabriel Stargardter and  Luis Rojas  Editing by  Kieran Murray   Claudia

After-hours action shows risk of knee-jerk trading, NEW YORK  Reuters  Depending on ones timing Mondays afterhours trading in JC Penney Co could have generated a windfall or served as a costly lesson in troubled stocks   The struggling retailers shares soared  at one point gaining nearly 13 percent  shortly after it was reported that Ron Johnsons controversial tenure as chief executive had come to an end The rally was shortlived After the company said it was bringing back Johnsons predecessor Myron Ullman shares slumped falling more than 20 percent to 1410 in the span of an hour as some investors called for the board of directors to resign The kneejerk rally which saw the share price touch 1788 turned into an opportunity for big investors to unload the stock Timeandsales figures shows dozens of trades of at least 10000 shares after Johnsons resignation was announced and after the stock hit its high for the postmarket session Theres a benefit to liquidating a position if you can said Dennis Dick a proprietary trader with Bright Trading in Las Vegas People dumped 100000 shares at a time as it rose Its rare to see trades of 100000 and I saw it multiple times last night They were making a bet that the stock wouldnt hold onto those gains and they were right Dick who said he played it a little said big sales came in reaction to the rally and then after the Ullman appointment was announced They used it as a chance to liquidate When the big guys are doing that you take note he said About 67 million shares traded in heavy activity between 5 pm and 6 pm EDT 21002200 GMT on Monday  about half the daily average of 148 million shares traded during regular trading over the last 50 days By contrast Bank of America Corp normally one of the stock markets most active issues saw less than 400000 shares change hands in that hour The dramatic reversal in JCP illustrates the peril of jumping into a volatile stock at a time when fewer investors are trading and the outcome is uncertain Things move faster given the lack of liquidity after hours and the stock jumped so fast with everyone shooting first and asking questions later said Michael Matousek senior trader at US Global Investors Inc in San Antonio which has a position in JC Penney It just shows that you cant really digest news or understand the implications of it within seconds of it breaking Much of the initial reaction was likely driven by highfrequency traders who make plays on market momentum rather than company fundamentals Dick described such players as having a time frame of milliseconds The stock pretty much covered its entire range from the past month probably because of algo trading probably because of how little liquidity there was Dick said referring to algorithmic trading which uses preprogrammed instructions to carry out orders Then as more information got digested it saw key reversals Some investors cautioned against trading in such circumstances especially in a name that has seen the kind of moves Penney has over the past few years Johnsons time at the helm was marked by a drop in sales and a 60 percent decline in share price over the past two years The news that Johnson would be replaced by Ullman Penneys previous chief executive contributed to a sharp reversal Shares fell as much as 11 percent to hit a low of 1410 shortly after 6 pm There may be trading opportunities but there are other stocks where you dont have to worry about shoes continuing to drop said Jeff Meyerson head of trading for Sunrise Securities in New York If you have to play it wait a few days and see where the dust settles Controversy is hard to trade Let someone else fight the battle In trading Tuesday the stock continued to struggle Shares were down another 105 percent to 1421 from Mondays close of 1587 on the heaviest day ever for volume Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica Editing by  David Gaffen  and  Leslie Gevirtz 
05/24/2010,Ackman may be eyeing exit as JC Penney bet in tatters, BOSTONNEW YORK  Reuters  William Ackmans multiyear bet that he could overhaul ailing retailer JC Penney  JCPN  looks like it may end up being one of his 12 billion hedge funds worst investment blunders   On Monday JC Penneys board dismissed Ron Johnson a former Apple executive handpicked by Ackman to remake the retailer and brought back Mike Ullman whom Ackman has previously criticized Now the hedge fund manager is likely searching for his own quick exit from an investment that is costing his 12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management millions in losses and has tarnished his reputation say industry analysts and investors Selling off parts or taking the company private would be ways to quit now that JC Penneys slumping stock price has cost Pershing Square some 500 million in paper losses people familiar with the firm said The faster Ackman and group sell JCPs valuable assets to someone else the more value they will capture said George Bradt managing director of PrimeGenesis an executive consulting firm The longer they stay distracted with suretofail ideas like fixing the business or taking it private the less value will be left when JCP finally ceases to exist Taking it private is also a viable way for Ackman to get out Even before Pershing Square and Vornado Realty Trust showed up in 2010 private equity investors were circling Today a purchase would be cheaper with the stock price near at 14 a share down about six dollars a share from where Ackman started buying And a deal would still be attractive for players like Blackstone Group  BXN  KKR  Co  KKRN  or Apollo Global Management LLC  APON  because JC Penney still has valuable real estate holdings owning nearly half of its space and leasing the rest at 4 a square foot Ackman has long championed JC Penneys vast real estate holdings as one reason the company should be trading at a higher stock price Joining the JC Penney board in 2011 he also said less than a year a ago that Pershing Square could make 15 times its money if Ron Johnsons ambitious turnaround plans worked But that strategy resulted in Johnsons dismissal and his plans to upgrade the stores and merchandise is in tatters Now Mike Ullman the CEO Ackman forced out has been brought back from retirement to run the company so there is little reason for an activist investor to stick around The usually voluble Ackman has yet to publicly comment on the management changes at JC Penney and he did not respond to a request for comment for this story Shares of JC Penney rose almost 11 percent late Monday after Johnson had been ousted but the stock fell when the company said Ullman was back and continued its plunge on Tuesday its shares down more than 10 percent in early afternoon trade What we have now is clearly the worst case scenario and Bill will be looking to make as graceful an exit as quickly as possible said one Pershing Square investor who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly Privately Ackman has long said the investment could be risky because it relied so heavily on shoppers liking Johnsons plan More stinging for Ackman personally may be that he appears to have been marginalized on a board that went back to the old boss even though Ullmans tenure may not be long given that he has no employment contract It appears the board is grasping for stability and the situation is more dire than outsiders realized said Damien Park the president of Hedge Fund Solutions which tracks activist investors who push for management changes Ackman and the remainder of the board have a lot of work to do to demonstrate theyre acting as a cohesive group One thing Ackman will likely not do is try to put the JC Penney investments into a side pocket the way some other hedge funds have done with their own poorly performing assets So far Pershing Square which has strict liquidity conditions where investors need about two years to get their money back has not been hit with heavy redemptions and the JC Penney investment is liquid enough to sell it off over time Pershing Square returned 61 percent during the first quarter even as JC Penneys stock was tumbling suggesting that investors have no reason to run for the exits right now But the pick does cast a shadow over Ackmans record where average annual returns of 20 percent have made him a favorite with pension funds and other big investors The failure of Ackmans candidate has resulted in substantially diminished credibility for him prospectively said one investor who is not invested with Ackman but did not want to be named due to his continuing work in the hedge fund industry This does not bode well for the boards receptivity to Ackmans future recommendations He is now a neutered activist the person said Reporting By Svea HerbstBayliss in Boston and Katya Wachtel in New York Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz

05/20/2010,Alcoa profit rises but price concerns linger, Reuters  Alcoa Inc  AAN  the largest US aluminum producer reported a higher quarterly profit on Monday thanks in part to strength at its raw materials segment but lowerthanexpected revenue and an uncertain outlook dragged down the companys share price   Stubbornly low aluminum prices have weighed on the companys business of mining bauxite refining it into alumina and smelting alumina to produce aluminum Most analysts when they update their spreadsheets probably will reduce their 2013 estimates for Alcoa because the metal price plunged so much in the last several weeks said John Tumazos an analyst at Very Independent Reseachcom Alcoa the first of the SP 500 companies to report firstquarter results is viewed as a bellwether for the materials sector and some look to it as a gauge of the health of the broader economy The company maintained its forecast of 7 percent growth in global aluminum demand this year and said it sees a tighter market with supply falling Recent growth at Alcoa has come from its engineered products segment which makes wheels aircraft parts and other goods In the justended quarter aftertax operating income also rose in the hardhit alumina and aluminum segments where Alcoa has cut highercost capacity Since the start of March the threemonth aluminum price has hovered under 2000 a metric ton 11023 tons  a level close to the cost of production at many smelters  due to sluggish global demand and plentiful supplies Aluminum prices are now down around 1900 a ton said Bridget Freas an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago Its very difficult for the company to make any meaningful improvement in their earnings around that level The lingering price slump has led to speculation that Alcoa could offload some raw material assets In an interview with cable channel CNBC after the results Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld declined to rule that out This is not the time to speculate he said Operating income slipped in the rolled products segment which produces sheet and plate metal hurt in part by weaker sales in industrial and commercial transportation markets On a call with analysts and investors Chief Financial Officer William Oplinger said Alcoa expects strong demand for rolled products from aerospace and automotive in the current quarter but continued pressure on prices in North America and China Prices have been hurt by excess inventory he said In the current quarter Oplinger said earnings are expected to rise 5 percent in engineered products 15 to 20 percent in rolled products and alumina and aluminum combined should be flat all when compared with the first quarter PRICE PRESSURE Net income rose to 149 million or 13 cents a share from 94 million or 9 cents a year earlier Its very nice that they came in at 13 cents but the ingot and alumina divisions are going to have a much tougher time in the June and September quarters said Tumazos the analyst at Very Independent Reseachcom Excluding restructuring charges and other items Alcoa earned to 121 million or 11 cents a share compared with 105 million or 10 cents a year earlier Analysts on average had been expecting 8 cents a share according to Thomson Reuters IBES Revenue slipped 3 percent to 583 billion shy of the 588 billion expected on average by analysts according to Thomson Reuters IBES Alcoa shares slipped 1 percent to 827 in postmarket trading after closing at 839 Reporting by Allison Martell Additional reporting by Josephine Mason  Carole Vaporean   Nichola Groom   Anna Driver   Cameron French  and  Euan Rocha  Editing by Frank McGurty Steve Orlofsky and Stephen Coates

01/14/2010,Viacom wins reversal in landmark YouTube case, Reuters  A US appeals court dealt Google Inc a major defeat by reviving lawsuits by Viacom Inc the English Premier League and various other media companies over the use of copyrighted videos on Googles YouTube service without permission   The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday reversed a June 2010 lower court ruling in favor of YouTube which had been considered a landmark in setting guidelines for websites to use content uploaded by users Its hard to characterize this as anything other than a loss for Google and potentially a significant one said Eric Goldman director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University School of Law It has given new life to a case that Google thought was dead The 1 billion lawsuit filed by Viacom in 2007 to stop the posting of clips from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart South Park SpongeBob SquarePants and other programs addressed a crucial issue for media companies how to win Internet viewers without ceding control of TV shows movies and music It was seen as a test of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act a 1998 federal law making it illegal to produce technology to circumvent antipiracy measures and limiting liability of online service providers for copyright infringement by users In his June 2010 ruling US District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan said YouTube could not be liable simply for having a general awareness that videos might be posted illegally and that it need not monitor for such activity But writing for a twojudge panel of the 2nd Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes concluded that a reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website The plaintiffs had accused YouTube of broadcasting about 79000 copyrighted videos on its website between 2005 and 2008 ADVERSARIES AND PARTNERS A YouTube spokeswoman said in an emailed statement All that is left of the Viacom lawsuit that began as a wholesale attack on YouTube is a dispute over a tiny percentage of videos long ago removed from YouTube Nothing in this decision impacts the way YouTube is operating Viacom in a statement said the appeals court delivered a definitive common sense message to YouTube intentionally ignoring theft is not protected by the law Other plaintiffs also welcomed the decision Needless to say my clients are delighted said Charles Sims a lawyer for the Premier League the English soccer league and several other plaintiffs YouTube willfully blinded itself to specific infringement and had ample ability to control infringing activity within the meaning of the copyright law Dozens of content providers filed socalled friendofthecourt briefs supporting the plaintiffs including the Associated Press Gannett Co the National Football League and the musical acts Garth Brooks Sting and the Eagles Google and YouTube also attracted dozens of supporters in court papers including eBay Inc Facebook Inc Yahoo Inc Human Rights Watch and Consumers Union New Yorkbased Viacom is controlled by Sumner Redstone and owns cable networks such as MTV and Comedy Central as well as the Paramount movie studio Google is based in Mountain View California and bought YouTube in November 2006 for about 165 billion Viacom and Google are not always adversaries On Wednesday YouTube announced a partnership to offer online rentals of nearly 500 Paramount films such as The Godfather WHAT SOMEONE FROM CNN SEES IT The 2nd Circuit agreed with Stanton that actual knowledge or awareness of facts or circumstances that indicate specific and identifiable instances of infringement should keep YouTube from invoking safe harbor provisions of the copyright law But the appeals court said it was unclear whether YouTube had red flag awareness of specific infringement It said the lower court should consider whether YouTube showed willful blindness in letting copyrighted videos remain on its website The 2nd Circuit quoted an email exchange on August 9 2005 six months after YouTubes founding in which cofounder Chad Hurley urged diligence about removing copyrighted content but met resistance to taking down a CNN clip of a space shuttle I really dont see what will happen What Someone from CNN sees it cofounder Steve Chen responded The CNN space shuttle clip I like cofounder Jawed Karim added We can remove it once were bigger and better known HAIRTRIGGER Goldman said the decision could add to the costs of online service providers even small ones to keep websites running It is not easy for a wellmeaning company to establish it is protected under the safe harbor part of the copyright law even if its service adds significant social value he said Even startup companies will need sophisticated legal counsel from day one Goldman continued It will make startups more hairtrigger on taking down news or content for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers The 2nd Circuit normally hears cases in threejudge panels The third judge on the YouTube case died while the case was pending In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Google shares fell 286 to 63229 while Viacom rose 81 cents to 4721 The cases are Viacom International Inc et al v YouTube Inc et al 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals No 103270 and The Football Association Premier League Ltd et al v YouTube Inc in the same court No

01/07/2010,BoE holds steady course as UK stumbles towards growth, LONDON  Reuters  The Bank of England held back from giving Britains fragile recovery an extra boost on Thursday as the economy appears to have avoided falling into recession despite a shock drop in manufacturing output in the first months of 2012   The economy has not recovered fully from the 20072009 recession that left Britons poorer and vulnerable to the euro zone debt crisis which fuelled a fall in output at the end of last year and raised fears of a new downturn A surprise 1 percent dive in manufacturing output in February announced earlier on Thursday showed that the economy was still on shaky ground after a series of more upbeat business surveys had indicated that a modest recovery was on track Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has warned of a long and arduous road back to economic health predicting a bumpy ride for most of 2012 as the dangers from the euro debt crisis linger and events such as an extra public holiday for the Queens Diamond Jubilee distort the course of the economy Even a minor technical recession  defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP  would be a blow for finance minister George Osborne who defended his tough austerity plan aimed at erasing a huge deficit in last months budget At its monthly meeting on Thursday the central banks Monetary Policy Committee MPC left the total of its asset purchases at 325 billion pounds and kept interest rates at their record low of 05 percent a move that had been unanimously expected by analysts polled by Reuters Since the end of 2011 when many were extremely concerned about an economic meltdown in the euro zone the shortterm outlook has improved said Scott Corfe economist at economics consultancy CEBR For the UK at least it looks as though a recession this year will be avoided The pound which has risen in recent weeks as the prospects of further monetary easing dwindled traded lower against the dollar on Thursday as the factory output data weighed NO MORE STIMULUS Most economists believe the BoE will not expand its quantitative easing program this year and the recent output figures did little to change that view Recent economic data has been more encouraging and with oil prices high theres now less certainty around how far and how fast inflation will fall said Ian McCafferty from the Confederation of British Industry The Bank of England along with the government is forecasting that lower inflation will bring some relief to consumers and allow more consumption But a recent jump in oil prices and rising food costs caused by a lack of rain in parts of England raised fears that inflation will not fall towards the BoEs 2 percent target as fast as policymakers hope Economists said Britain should return to growth in the first three months of 2012 as the wider measure of industrial output grew in February thanks to increased energy production The dominant services sector has also been improving Nonetheless the government predicts growth of just 08 percent this year only a fraction more than in 2011 In another encouraging sign that some consumers are confident enough to spend more new car registrations rose by 18 percent in March data showed on Thursday Domestic demand for new cars is showing signs of recovery said the chief executive of car lobby SMMT Paul Everitt BRITONS WOES Consumers have taken a hammering from a combination of the governments austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit rising prices that have outpaced wage growth and the relatively higher cost of credit from banks compared to previous years The Conservative Party the senior partner in the governing coalition with the Liberal Democrats has so far defended its lead in opinion polls when it comes to economic policy despite unrelenting calls for action to boost the economy However a poll showed on Thursday that Prime Minister David Camerons approval rating has tumbled to its lowest level since he was elected almost two years ago after two weeks in which policy gaffes and a funding scandal battered the Conservatives With the governments hands tied by its promise to erase the budget deficit in order to protect Britains cherished topnotch credit rating the onus to boost growth has been firmly on the Bank of England A sizeable minority of economists still expect more stimulus from the BoE  though not until May at the earliest when its current asset purchases are complete We have a sneaking suspicion that the Bank of England is not quite yet done on the QE front said Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight This reflects our belief that the economy is likely to stutter over the coming months in the face of still serious domestic and international headwinds and that a majority of MPC members may feel that a final small helping hand is in order he said The minutes of the policymakers discussions at this months meeting will be published on April 18 By May

12/30/2009,"Insight: In Bangalore a remake to avoid being ""Bangalored""", BANGALORE  Reuters  Rajesh Rao is among a handful of Indian entrepreneurs who may prevent the countrys software industry from getting Bangalored   The 41yearold selfconfessed geek runs Dhruva a firm that sells content and services to global online game companies from a bungalow in a crowded suburb of a city that has come to embody outsourcing and the transfer of jobs from the West But plain vanilla outsourcing  help desks and back office operations  is finding cheaper locations abroad Indias software industry has discovered it needs to move up the value chain or enter niche areas like gaming to continue growing Rao a dapper man with a soul patch beard was drawn to multimedia computing while at university and set up his own firm He progressed to video gaming and says he lucked into a sector that is now realizing its potential It is less than a 500 million business in India  and 50 billion worldwide and growing Whenever something transcends from a geek activity to an everyday activity thats when you can say that this is now going to become mainstream Rao said at his unpretentious headquarters set amid shops a temple a womens college and cheekbyjowl homes As gaming scales up the advantages of outsourcing are becoming apparent to the firms on the US West Coast that dominate the sector Jobs that can cost up to 1200015000 per manmonth there can be outsourced to companies in India like Dhruva for about 40005000 The gaming industry began to discover the benefits of outsourcing and we were already there and so we started seeing a huge upswing in business Rao said speaking in a new office set up as he expands staff Many of the desks are unoccupied and cabling has yet to be completed We are now beginning to see that big wave Pretty much the floodgates are opening San Franciscobased Zynga which started off games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars on Facebook has also bet on Bangalore setting up an office and a creative studio the first outside the United States with over 200 employees Thomson Reuters itself has more than 6000 staff in technology sales editorial and customer support in Bangalore Zynga Chief Technology Officer Cadir Lee said the city was attractive because it combined experience and talent I see Bangalore going through a pyramid where you started with lowervalue functions like call centre work then it moved up to BPO business process outsourcing and more strategic IT projects but still very directed work he said in a telephone interview At the top of that is product development That is just getting critical mass in Bangalore THE UPGRADE Indias IT industry with Bangalore firms forming the largest component is now worth an annual 100 billion and growing 14 percent per year one of the few bright spots in an economy blighted by policy stagnation and political instability But growth has tapered off from 20 plus percent a few years ago Rising wages uneven infrastructure and a talent pool that doesnt fully meet requirements are other worrying factors Technology and special skillsets are the answer analysts say Indian companies are now into engineering services alternative business models and biotechnology as well as animation and gaming Many will offer increased revenue in addition to cost savings Gaming product development the D of RD research and development applied research engineering and design  you can see all forms of these emerging in India said Noshir Kaka managing director of McKinsey and Cos India operations We are going to see a whole range of alternative business models that are going to emerge You are going to see companies that are going to put together a proprietary platform with some processing capability added to that software development and data and analytics and give it as a combined offering You start changing the business value proposition to a client Around the turn of the century the confluence of better communications and fiberoptic networks a pool of software talent and government incentives for the IT industry made Bangalore the global hub of outsourcing It started mostly as a lowcost way of dealing with issues like the Y2K bug but it then fundamentally began to alter international business Companies in the West began to relocate hundreds of thousands of jobs to India In 2008 alone companies in the United States and Europe saved over 20 billion by outsourcing services to India according to a McKinsey report Once called a pensioners paradise a favored retirement spot for army and government officers Bangalore became one of only two cities in the world to have a verb derived from its name the other is Shanghai Getting Bangalored came to mean losing a job to outsourcing Hyderabad a rival outsourcingfocused city 550 km to the north began to be called Cyberabad But as incomes rose lowvalue jobs like call centers and help desks began to make the transition to even cheaper locations like the Philippines and Eastern Europe Part of the answer says BVR Mohan Reddy the founder of Hyderabadbased engineering services firm Infotech is a leapfrog in technology So far this business has been very linear As more technology maturity and confidence come into this industry you will certainly find people  moving to the next plateau Infotech with estimated revenue this year seen up 22 percent at 250 million is among the most technically advanced firms India providing services like computeraided design for aircraft engines and digitalization of drawings and maps We do participate with our customers at this point of time said Reddy in a phone interview Though we are a services company our engineers names have started appearing in the list of patents Firms like Infosys Indias 6 billion outsourcing giant are moving up the value chain in their own way and switching from traditional markets in the United States and Europe We are looking at new areas like embedded systems we have accelerated our consulting growth we have focused on emerging markets much more said founder NR Narayana Murthy a legend in the industry We have enhanced involvement in the digital economy health care is a big area of opportunity he said in an interview at the sprawling Infosys headquarters in Bangalore THE TALENT POOL The limiting factor is a shortage of jobready engineers with companies willing to pay a premium for workers who have proved themselves in other IT firms But that adds to costs and risks making companies uncompetitive or doing to them what they have done to companies in the West Infosys solves the problem by trawling universities for graduates and then training them for up to eight months Talent shops where industryready skills are taught have emerged elsewhere From socalled bodyshopping in the software industry in the 80s and 90s now we have come to a stage where complete RD outsourcing is happening said JA Chowdary who runs Talent Sprint a company that provides training to IT professionals This calls for a huge jump in quality manpower Many engineering colleges are able to produce students but Nasscom National Association of Software and Services Companies says only 20 percent are employable So theres a big shortfall Other estimates say only about a quarter of the 770000 engineering graduates each year are ready to join the workforce Another quarter needs training and the rest will take on nonsoftware jobs or remain unemployed Because the numbers are so huge Indias IT sector will continue to grow albeit at a slower pace But Srini Raju who runs the Peepul venture capital fund aimed at the IT sector said Indians by and large lacked the innovation and entrepreneurship skills to bolt on to talent and technology to make cuttingedge products themselves Theres no hunger he said I am not saying they are not hardworking The sacrifice and hunger are not there In the West they would have slept in their office for a week together Here at 5 oclock in the evening they start getting phone calls I am not saying this is right or wrong That is the way this society is India is not a country for innovation any time soon Raju said he had about 700 million invested in Indian companies but mostly in service providers I will not invest in innovation he said I will invest in doers You can build businesses around doers Around innovation no Its a lack of people who will do it Narayana Murthy at Infosys dismissed talk of a perennial lack of innovative talent and said India would one day produce an entrepreneur like Steve Jobs Its impossible for me to predict what the Indian Steve Jobs will do he said But I am sure there will be one Lets remember our story is still pretty young Innovation will come Editing by
